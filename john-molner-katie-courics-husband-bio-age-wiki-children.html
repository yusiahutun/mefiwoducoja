This fact best describes the relationship between John Molner and his famous wife, Katie Couric.</p><p>Before their marriage, Molner, although successful himself, was not really known to the public. It was only after he had made the alliance with Couric, a media mogul, renowned journalist, and insider into the hall of fame of television, that his popularity skyrocketed. The couple’s marital relationship has earned respect not only in the entertainment world but also attention and followers both on the Internet and in real life. Join us as we reveal all the facts about John Molner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>John Molner – Wiki, Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>The husband of Katie Couric was born in Chicago, Illinois, on January 21, 1963, the son of Paula Molner and Herbert Molner. John grew up with his two brothers David Molner (a film financier) and Tom Molner (a lawyer).</p><p>It is believed that the banker cum financier graduated from elementary and high school in the United States. As for his college education, he first studied at Trinity College and later graduated from the Chicago Booth School of Business. He was then hired as a financier by the New York-based private bank Brown Brothers Harriman.</p><p>After investing his expertise for several years at Brown Brothers, John Molner retired in 2014. Despite his retirement, the Chicago-born financier continues to serve as a senior advisor to the bank.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Juliet Richardson Biography And Everything You Need To Know</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family: Wife And Children</strong></h2><p>John Molner has two biological children – a son named Henry Molner and a daughter named Allie Molner. Both were born to his former wife Jane Franke Molner, from whom he divorced after their marriage. Despite their parents’ divorce, Allie and Henry have been part of their respective lives. During her father’s marriage to Katie, they were among those who celebrated their big day with them.</p><p>A wonderful father figure, John helps his wife raise their two daughters, Caroline Monahan and Elinor Mohanan, who were the result of their intimate relationship with her first husband, Jay Monahan. Jay died in 1998 from complications of colon cancer. Elinor and Caroline were also present during their mother’s second marriage with her lover, the banker.</p><p>The marriage of John Molner and Katie Couric was not their first. Their relationship was triggered by the divorce of the former and the death of the husband of the latter. The couple crossed paths for the first time in 2011, after which they became friends and then lovers.</p><p>Molner and Couric were friends until sometime in September 2013, when the banker asked the question. Although Katie really took her time before she finally accepted to marry John, the journalist was worth the wait.</p><p>The financier, who had previously dated American financier Jessica Hsu briefly based on reports, married Couric on June 21, 2014, at her Hamptons home in the presence of close friends and family. They had a small wedding, which was celebrated by the couple’s mutual friend, John Ellis. Since then, John and his family have lived in their newly acquired mansion in New York City. They reportedly bought the property for $12 million.</p><p>Speaking of John Molner’s beautiful wife, Katie is one of the best and most respected journalists and media personalities the U.S. has ever produced.
