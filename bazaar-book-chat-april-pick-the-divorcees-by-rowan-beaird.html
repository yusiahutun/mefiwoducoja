I thought it was really interesting how the author started the novel in the future and worked backward‚Äîalso didn‚Äôt know divorce ranches existed in the ‚Äô50s!<br>‚ù§Ô∏è1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel Calfee (editorial and social media assistant)</strong><br>Okay, first off, I had no idea that divorce ranches existed, and I ended up in a deep spiral reading up about them when I started this book, lol. What a weirdly roundabout way to make that happen!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>Same. I had no idea, and after starting the book I went down a divorce ranch rabbit hole, and it‚Äôs so fascinating‚Äîawful what women had to do to get a divorce, but so interesting. It also lends to an intriguing space and situation for a story‚Äîa bunch of hurt women eager to break loose from their husbands, living in one place and going to the bar every night‚Äîand I think Beaird did a good job creating suspense in the first few chapters to ultimately lead us to the drama at the end.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel Calfee</strong><br>It‚Äôs giving like the opposite of Don‚Äôt Worry Darling, hahaha.<br>‚ùóÔ∏è2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>But also weirdly controlled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>Agreed, I think setting the book at a divorce ranch was so brilliant because it innately led to really interesting explorations of class and gender and agency within a very specific framework.<br>‚ù§Ô∏è1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Tiffany Dodson</strong><br>Totally! especially once the story revealed that there were different classes of divorce ranches in the area.<br>‚ùóÔ∏è2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>The conversation around class was sooo interesting. And how Lois feels so out of place with her clothes, and the women obsess over Greer because she seems like she might be rich.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What did you think about the relationship between Lois and Greer and how it evolves as the story goes on?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>At first I loved [Greer] because she eschewed (now antiquated) notions of what a woman should look and be like at that time and challenged the girls to do the same. But as the book wore on, I definitely became wary of her.<br>üíØ4</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was all about not letting anyone control you as a woman, yet she definitely had some sort of control over Lois and the other girls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>Totally. I was like, What a cool girl. And then when she started giving them orders, I was like‚Ä¶Is she maybe crazy?<br>üíØ1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel Calfee</strong><br>I thought it was interesting that no one knows Greer‚Äôs name at first. They just keep referring to her as ‚Äúthe new girl.‚Äù I think that automatically lent a sense of mystery to her character, and it suggests she wants to maintain this mystique or something.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>Yeah. It took a sec for me to think she was hiding something bigger with all that mystery.<br>re: their relationship, I feel like it became so much about obsession and desire and about Lois wanting not only Greer‚Äôs attention but also sort of to be her. On the other hand, I think we come to learn that other women build genuine bonds due to their shared experiences. It feels like if Lois had given them the time of day, she would‚Äôve been able to find a friendship like the one she was so eager to have with Greer.<br>‚ùóÔ∏è2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Chelsey Sanchez </strong><strong>(associate editor)</strong><strong></strong><br>Honestly, Greer and Lois‚Äôs friendship reminded me somewhat of the friendship between J.Lo‚Äôs and Constance Wu‚Äôs characters in Hustlers lol. Or even Roxie and Velma in Chicago. Greer has that femme fatale thing going on.<br>üòÇ3</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Tiffany Dodson</strong><br>In the beginning, I thought it was nice that Lois and Greer were building a friendship, since Lois felt so separated and awkward around the other women at the ranch. But as I kept reading, it kind of seemed like Greer was treating Lois like her little pet, instead of an equal, which was strange. But I agree‚ÄîLois definitely wanted to be Greer at first, especially around the time she agreed to mend her loose button and ended up trying her shirt completely on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel Calfee</strong><br>It‚Äôs also interesting that early on, Greer calls Lois a liar lol. She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou tell everyone different stories.‚Äù Could you imagine someone you just met coming out guns blazing like that?<br>‚ùóÔ∏è1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>The shirt scene was totally giving Jacob Elordi‚Äôs <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46455752/jacob-elordi-reaction-saltburn-bathtub-water-candle/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bathwater vibes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">bathwater vibes</a> (from Saltburn).<br>üíÄ4</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Did any other women at the ranch intrigue you? Or did their storylines just push you to be more curious about Lois and Greer? I was pretty intrigued by the house mom (I forget her name) and how she seemed to genuinely care about the girls and was just left with nothing at the end. Hers seemed like one of the saddest stories for me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>Rita! I loved Rita. She seemed to know that Greer was bad news from the beginning. But no one would listen to her‚Äîand as a reader, I didn‚Äôt blame them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Initially, she seemed overbearing, but you come to realize that she‚Äôs probably seen some shit and has good instincts.<br>‚ùóÔ∏è4</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Tiffany Dodson</strong><br>Rita was just trying to keep everyone together!<br>‚ù§Ô∏è2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Chelsey Sanchez</strong><br>Rita and Greer seemed to be foils of each other‚Äîthey both kind of represent these opposite outcomes of what it means to be an independent woman surviving divorce in the ‚Äô50s.<br><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://emojipedia.org/heart-on-fire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ô∏è‚Äçüî• class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</a>3</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I also really felt for Mary Elizabeth throughout the novel. She comes across as extremely naive in the beginning, but has endured probably some of the worst compared to the other women at the ranch.<br>üíØ1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Tiffany Dodson</strong><br>From the ongoing phone calls to her husband repeatedly showing up at the ranch to the Luminal‚Äîheartbreaking.<br>‚ùó2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>She seemed so sad. And her insane husband really puts a lot of the domestic-violence issues back then into perspective. Like why some of these women had to literally escape to a ranch in the middle of nowhere.<br>‚ùó2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">How did you guys feel about the roles the men played in this‚Äîthe husbands, the dudes at the bars, etc.?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>I loved that they were always sort of in the background or secondary, since most stories that were told (in books, on film, etc.) during that time period rarely centered women.<br>‚ù§Ô∏è 1‚ùó2 üíØ1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>And they were all so creepy!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>Except Charlie! But yeah, thinking about all the creeps that probably went to bars in Reno just to meet women going through divorce‚Ä¶it feels very icky.<br>‚ùó2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>I did feel kinda bad for Charlie, with some of the women saying he was too low-class and smelled like cows.üò≠ But again, very of the era with the class commentary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>Totally. And he was so isolated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Chelsey Sanchez</strong><br>It felt like the function of nearly all the male characters was to show how this system was built to cater entirely to them. There‚Äôs the obvious example with Mary Elizabeth's ex-husband, who is overtly cruel and abusive; but even Lois‚Äôs ex-husband, who is initially portrayed as sweet and good-natured, exploits his wife‚Äôs position in society as someone without institutional power and agency. His behavior may seem benign, but it‚Äôs such an act of interpersonal violence to throw away your wife‚Äôs form of contraception‚Ä¶and then withhold the money you promised her after the divorce.<br>‚ùó3</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>This! Even Lois‚Äôs lawyer tried asking her out after her divorce was finalized. Like, sir.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Chelsey Sanchez</strong><br>Read the room!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>Totally agree. The lawyer was creepy and annoying, some husbands were violent, others boring and narcissistic. The men at the bar just wanted to take advantage of the girls. But it‚Äôs ironic that the person who ends up betraying the girls in the end is one of their own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>A sheep in men‚Äôs clothing.<br><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://emojipedia.org/heart-on-fire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ô∏è‚Äçüî• class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</a>2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>So accurate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, throughout the book we get a big evolution from Lois, and despite how her relationship with Greer ends, do you think she needed Greer to find herself?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Chelsey Sanchez</strong><br>I do kind of think Lois needed Greer to evolve, but moreso because Lois needed genuine connection‚Äîwhich, up until she got to the ranch, she just didn‚Äôt have with anyone else in her life. It‚Äôs clear that she was an outsider in school, and that her relationships with her family and ex-husband were superficial at best. Something about feeling seen by Greer probably allowed her to embrace herself in a way she never had before.<br>‚ùó1 üíØ1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Ariana Marsh</strong><br>I agree. I think she needed someone to also show her that an independent future post-ranch was possible, since none of the other women pursued that, really.<br>‚ùó2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>I also think that in becoming fascinated with Greer and seeing herself as an object of fascination in Greer‚Äôs eyes, she grew. She began to feel more confident in herself through the way she behaved and even dressed. She was met with a choice to rebel and do the bad thing for once in her life‚Äîand then she pulled herself out of it. And in the end, despite how she feels about Greer, she does take her advice when it comes to men and, in some ways, to her own life as an independent, unmarried woman.<br>‚ù§Ô∏è 1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Tiffany Dodson</strong><br>I agree‚ÄîI think bonding with Greer was the impetus Lois needed to ultimately find inner strength as a single, independent woman and put herself first‚Äîeven to eat the way that she wanted to!<br>‚ù§Ô∏è 2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>It‚Äôs giving <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a60547135/taylor-swift-kim-kardashian-songs-the-tortured-poets-department-lyrics-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="‚ÄúthanK you aIMee.‚Äù" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">‚ÄúthanK you aIMee.‚Äù<br></a>üíÄ2</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Rosa Sanchez</strong><br>Wait, side note, did anyone else find it weird that the author kept talking about thumbs? Thumbs bleeding, thumb marks.
