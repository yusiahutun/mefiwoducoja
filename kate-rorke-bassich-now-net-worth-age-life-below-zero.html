Did she remarry after her split from Andy Bassich? Why did she leave the show?</p><p>Here are a few things we’ve unearthed from the internet that attempt to answer all these questions.</p><h3><strong>Why Did Kate Rorke-Bassich Leave Life Below Zero?</strong></h3><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich joined the castaways for Life Below Zero in 2013 but left the show after 43 episodes in 2015. During Season 10 Kate ended her marriage with her husband Andy Bassich, and also made her last appearance on National Geographic’s popular show on the episode “Out of Control.”</p><p>There was no clarification about why she left the show. But many assumed that she had died but that is not the case.</p><p>Although Kate herself didn’t clarify why she left the show, it is believed that her marriage with Andy has everything to do with her departure from the show. In August 2017, Kate posted a throwback and posted about her ex-husband writing, “Little did I know that a few days after this photo was taken I would meet a sociopath who would change my life ….not for the good.”</p><p>One fan wrote, “In my opinion, she probably left because of that ugly so and so treated her, and now he has another to work and slave for him. Wake up women, for God’s sake. He is what I call hoarder and loser and user.”</p><p>Another fan wrote, “After how I saw how hard Andy was on Kate I am not surprised she left. What a jerk.”</p><p>Kate was married to Andy Bassich who is not originally from Alaska. In the year 2003, she met Andy Bassich. As part of a group of visitors, Kate was traveling to Dawson City. In the same group, she met Andy. They had several dates, fell in love, lived in the same city, and eventually got married.</p><p>Andy and Kate made their separation official in 2015. The divorce was finalized and Kate moved out a year later, which put an end to her appearances on the Nat Geo series. Later, she spoke openly about the breakup, alleging that Andy had abused her physically and mentally.</p><h3><strong>What Is Kate Rorke-Bassich Doing Now?</strong></h3><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich is now residing in <span class=xt0psk2>Carbonear, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and is living her life.</span></p><p><span class=xt0psk2>On Facebook, Kate posts occasionally, and fans are happy to hear from her every once in a while. She most recently posted in September 2023 and wrote, “To all my friends are out there still a good night.”</span></p><p>In April 2022, Kate apologized to her followers for not actively posting on her Facebook. She wrote, “It has been a rough and extremely doing nothing, boring and depressing year or so due to Covid, off-the-wall political deviousness ￼and some health problems (nothing to worry about). Change is coming and I expect to be back with my usual vim and vigour￼ in short order.<span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">&nbsp;</span>You all have been the best of the angels anyone could have asked for and I feel terribly guilty for being absent for so long.”</p><p>Kate also shared about her thyroid cancer in July 2021. She explained on her FB, “50-50 chance and so-called friends wonder why I am being elusive or testy or rude… I haven’t felt well for quite a while, Now they’re looking at the cancer of my thyroid. They didn’t believe me when I had hemochromatosis like my brother but That proved to be correct. The next step is thyroid. Never fu*king rains unless it God damn pours. I’m angry, I’m scared and I am totally frustrated.”</p><p>She has not posted anything about re-marrying or dating anyone in the wake of her split from Andy, however.</p><h3><strong>Did Kate Rorke-Bassich And Andy Bassich Have A Daughter?</strong></h3><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich and Andy Bassich don’t share any children together. But, Kate is a mother to one daughter named Amy Rorke from the previous relationship.</p><p>In April 2017, Kate documented a mother-daughter trip to Maui and posted on her Facebook, “The most wonderful Mother & Daughter vacation in Maui. Thanks for the memories, Amy<span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">.”</span></p><p>On Amy’s birthday in January 2018, she wished her daughter, “For my Baby Girl, Amy. Then and Now. My daughter and best friend. Happy Birthday my lovely<span class="x3nfvp2 x1j61x8r x1fcty0u xdj266r xhhsvwb xat24cr xgzva0m xxymvpz xlup9mm x1kky2od">.”</span></p><h3><strong>Kate Rorke-Bassich Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1956, Kate Rorke-Bassich turned 67 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kate Rorke-Bassich Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, Kate Rorke-Bassich’s net worth exceeds $350 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Kate Rorke-Bassich Height</strong></h3><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich’s height measures above 5 feet 5 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Kate Rorke-Bassich From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich hailed from <span class=xt0psk2>Carbonear, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Kate Rorke-Bassich Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kate Rorke-Bassich’s birthday is on 24 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Kate Rorke-Bassich On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Kate Rorke-Bassich doesn’t seem to be on Instagram.
