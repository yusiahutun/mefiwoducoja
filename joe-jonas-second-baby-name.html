While oh-so-casually modeling with a unicorn for Harper’s Bazaar UK, Turner explained that she and Jonas had quite a few mutual friends try to set them up, but it just never ended up happening. She said it must have been fate, though, because “[they] were following each other on Instagram, and he direct messaged [her] one fine day, out of the blue.” Bold move! But clearly, it worked in his favor. It’s also a technique that the JoBros seem to really like. Nick Jonas slid into his now-wife’s Twitter DMs with the line, “I think we should connect.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-stormi-bree.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-peregrine-pearson.png><p>A year later, he popped the question, and they got married in Vegas in 2019. Their first child, daughter Willa, was born in 2020 and their second, another daughter, in 2022. “It’s been amazing to be a dad and to learn every day more about myself and what that’s like,” Jonas&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;at the time. “It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation,” Turner told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elle</a>&nbsp;UK. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”</p><p>Now, as news (and rumors) surrounding their split spreads like wildfire, we’ve learned a clue about <a href=#>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s second baby’s name</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-s-second-baby-s-name>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s second baby’s name</h2><p>The hint to <a href=# id=auto-tag_joe-jonas data-tag=joe-jonas>Joe Jonas</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_sophie-turner data-tag=sophie-turner>Sophie Turner</a>’s second baby’s name can be found in the divorce filings. Court documents obtained by Us Weekly show the couple’s two children: the initials W.J. are listed for their eldest daughter, Willa (born in 2020), followed by the initials D.J. for their second daughter, born in 2022.</p><p>Turner mentioned Willa to her Instagram followers for the first time while celebrating Mother’s Day in March 2021. “I’m so grateful to the two loves of my life for making me a mama,” she wrote at the time. “@joejonas and my beautiful baby girl. It’s my favorite job I’ve ever had.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-divorce.jpg><p>Some sources, quoted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>MailOnline</a>, have said that Turner felt robbed of her young adulthood by marrying Jonas at 23 and spending her teen years on Game of Thrones.</p><p>The friend revealed: “Sophie feels like she’s only just waking up to what her life and reality really is. She became famous at a very young age, then married and had kids at a young age and never really had the teenage years of sleeping around and just having carefree fun with friends.”</p><p>The source continued: “She feels like her life has stalled after Game of Thrones and so has her personal life. Since the kids came along, she’s feeling trapped. She’s the only person in her tight friendship group who is married with two children. Now she feels that she wants to make up for the time she’s lost as a young person. He (Joe) wants a more settled life but she’s not ready for that because she feels that she’s not even had a teen or young adult life.”</p><p>The friend also said that family priorities were a point of contention between the couple: “Joe would like another kid, he’s a real family man. But while Sophie’s been in the UK, she’s also realized just how much she misses this country; it’s the final nail in the coffin for them.”</p><p>In a joint statement issued to Instagram, the couple explained: “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children,” they said.</p><p>Some anonymous sources quoted in tabloids have tried to place the blame solely on Turner in a typical anti-female manner, claiming that she had been an absent mother too focused on “partying” to be a mother.</p><p>“Divorce was a last resort for Joe. He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls,” an insider told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>. “An unhappy home isn’t a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year. There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported.” The source concluded: “It just kept building, and Joe finally reached a point where he felt that he had exhausted all options to salvage the marriage.”</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported that “multiple sources” said that “Joe had access to a ring cam that he said captured Sophie saying and/or doing something that made him realize the marriage was over.” Whatever that means.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/joe-jonas-sophie-turner.jpg><p>Divorce documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>&nbsp;revealed, “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,” with sources explaining that the split did not come as a “surprise” to those who were close to the couple. “They were not separated but they’ve been living separate lives for months,” the source said. “As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real-time. They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the UK.”</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;added that they were told Turner and Jonas have had “serious problems” for the good part of the year, and that “Joe has been caring for their 2 young children “pretty much all of the time,” even as his band was touring. We’re told Joe currently has both kids, as the group plays around the U.S.”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>, meanwhile, reported that Jonas “had retained a divorce lawyer”, though the article noted that reps for neither star commented on the rumors.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
