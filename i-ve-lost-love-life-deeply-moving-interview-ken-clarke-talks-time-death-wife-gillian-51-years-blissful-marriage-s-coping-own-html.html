Done so, he tells me, in a brandy and cigar-fugged stream of consciousness.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They include lots about the Thatcher Years and how she wept when she lost power. And about the rows behind the scenes on Black Wednesday, when sterling’s collapse bumped the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, fore-runner of the euro. About his three failed bids to become Conservative leader (‘no one can accuse me of not trying’) and David Cameron’s bizarre control-freakish behaviour. But surprisingly little about Ken himself.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I’m the least clammed-up person you could meet when it comes to confrontation and promulgating my view,’ he says. ‘But despite all the efforts of my literary agent and publishers, I’m the most clammed up about my private life — I just don’t discuss it.’</span></p><img id=i-b4af29faa0ae4fce src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/10/00/0042971800000258-3829950-image-m-50_1476057366867.jpg height=589 width=634 alt="Mr Clarke admits in an interview with The Daily Mail he is most clammed up about his private life, especially that with his wife Gillian (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Mr Clarke admits in an interview with The Daily Mail he is most clammed up about his private life, especially that with his wife Gillian (pictured)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Then Ken, 76, proceeds to chat for an hour and a half about everything and anything: mostly how he has coped with becoming a widower last summer after 51 years of marriage, but also his burning passions for jazz, bird-watching, football and Romanesque church architecture.</span></p>Gillian gave me security, a home, a life away from politics<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>We touch on his worries about impending retirement (‘you’ve got to plan it, you can’t just suddenly retire or you’ll end up just watching ridiculous amounts of cricket’); the inevitability of death (‘when you’re my age, you’re practically doomed’); his worrying tendency to make decisions too quickly; and the vast quantities of food and booze it takes to maintain his wonderfully florid face and comfortable girth.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I’m not nearly as fat in person as I appear in the cartoons, but I can’t remember how much I weigh,’ he says. ‘And I’m a great believer that if you’re going to get overweight, you should do it on decent quality food.’</span></p><img id=i-7ce478f2247cd24a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/10/00/00F1C25900000191-3829950-image-m-52_1476057389953.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="The Clarke's wedding day in 1964: Mr Clarke became a widower last summer after 51 years of marriage to Gillian" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Clarke's wedding day in 1964: Mr Clarke became a widower last summer after 51 years of marriage to Gillian</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Which, for him, involves eating out most days — three-course lunches, gastronomic feasts hosted by the many dining clubs of which he’s a member, chicken kormas in his local curry house, pig-outs at the Garrick Club in London (‘I just don’t get to the Garrick enough!’).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And, when he’s at home in Nottingham, pub lunches and pork pies from the local delicatessen (‘I try to avoid bad stuff’).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Not forgetting the booze, of course: red wine, ideally a robust Malbec or Rioja (‘As I’m getting older, the nuances of the finest claret are quite lost on me’), white wine, pints and calvados brandy.</span></p><img id=i-6d5cc79e095bbc75 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/10/00/0042B09E00000258-3829950-image-m-55_1476057418568.jpg height=549 width=306 alt="Ken and Gillian met as Cambridge undergraduates in the early Sixties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Ken and Gillian met as Cambridge undergraduates in the early Sixties</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Alcohol’s always been a pleasure for me,’ he says.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I know that if you live alone, you have to be careful about not drinking on your own, but I’m a gregarious person and it livens up chatting with friends.’ He doesn’t give a fig about the health risks.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘The dangers for me from alcohol are now nil. I think by now I know how to reap the benefits,’ he says. ‘I’ve been drinking ever since I was at school and looked old enough to fool a blind barman.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He says that he has not had a day without a drink since.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Not ever, I’m afraid,’ he says. ‘I don’t drink as much as I did, but I don’t follow the limits laid down by these ever more puritanical health advisers any more than anyone else does.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He also smokes cigars enthusiastically; little ones during the day ‘to keep the cost down’, topped off by ‘one decent one’ late at night, with a glass of brandy.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The irony is not lost on him that he outlived his clean-living and devoutly religious (‘Anglican high church — all smells and bells’) wife.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I never even saw her remotely tipsy, let alone drunk,’ he says. ‘If there was any justice in this world, she would obviously have outlived me.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ken and Gillian met as Cambridge undergraduates in the early Sixties. She was an academic; he a very bright, working-class ex-grammar-school boy from Nottinghamshire who’d wanted to be an MP since he was seven and hung out with fellow students Norman Fowler, Michael Howard and Norman Lamont, who all went on to become Tory ministers.</span></p><img id=i-b4d3400feaf55382 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/10/00/00F1C1BD00000191-3829950-image-a-56_1476057442639.jpg height=554 width=634 alt="Gillian and Kenneth Clarke pictured in 1993 as a young family with their children Kenneth (left) and Sue (right)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Gillian and Kenneth Clarke pictured in 1993 as a young family with their children Kenneth (left) and Sue (right)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘She was the love of my life and kept me in touch with reality. She gave me security, a home, a life away from politics,’ he says. Her death left him reeling and he has been searching for what he calls ‘my normality’ ever since. Not, he insists, by weeping, or ‘sitting at home just festering and gazing out of the window’, but by keeping busy.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Losing Gillian was the biggest, most dramatic thing in my life — outside politics, that is — but I long ago came to terms with the fact that death is one of those things that just happens. You have to somehow get on with your life, knowing perfectly well that eventually you’re going to fall off your perch yourself.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>While she took comfort from her faith, he doesn’t share it. So it was work that saved him.</span></p><img id=i-e2e76d0c3aa99917 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/10/10/00/393D698E00000578-3829950-image-a-62_1476057582708.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Mr Clarke told The Daily Mail&nbsp;‘losing Gillian was the biggest, most dramatic thing in my life — outside politics, that is'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Mr Clarke told The Daily Mail&nbsp;‘losing Gillian was the biggest, most dramatic thing in my life — outside politics, that is'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He nearly didn’t stand for his Rushcliffe seat in the last general election because Gillian was so ill at the time — after a ten-year, on-and-off battle with cancer, her lymphoma had reappeared with a vengeance. In the event, their trip to the polling booth in June 2015 was their last. She was gravely ill and, when he got home early from the count, he had to rush her into hospital.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘She never came out,’ he says, all quiet and pink and muttery. ‘She’s gone. There’s no sense she’s still around. None. But I’ve got lots of photos and fond memories.

Both his parents left school at 13; his father was never offered a secondary education and his mother was refused one on the basis that it would be wasted on a girl, but this didn’t hold them back. Ken Sr became an electrician, cinema manager and, later, watchmaker and jeweller and, despite his wife’s on/off battles with depression, the family managed to live largely happily and in considerable style, in a pleasant semi-detached house with their own car.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ken’s grandparents, on both sides, were rather more colourful.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Grandfather Clarke ran away to sea as a boy, travelled the world, occasionally dabbled as a house painter and had an arresting effect on the ladies.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His first wife fled on their wedding night, to be replaced by Ken’s grandmother — a gipsy, according to Clarke family legend. Her ‘sister’ (more likely, her daughter) came as part of the package and for years, all three lived very happily together.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>So much so, that when Ken’s gipsy granny died, her sister/daughter promptly married his grandfather.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>On the other side of the family, his maternal grandfather was a toolmaker at the Raleigh bicycle factory, an obsessive enterer of magazine competitions and a communist — forever telling his grandson to read the Daily Worker, while Ken far preferred the Daily Mail.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Indeed, from the tender age of five, young Ken read the Daily Mail avidly, absorbing every detail of the Attlee government elected in 1945.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He became utterly bewitched by unfolding political events and, with the help of the Daily Mail and endless homemade political scrapbooks, astonishingly well-informed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>By the time he was seven, he was following Chancellor Stafford Cripps’ robust economic policies and rejoicing at the demise of Baron Shinwell, the minister for fuel and power whom he (and the Daily Mail) held responsible for the great coal shortage of 1947 and endless power cuts. At about the same time, he stood up in class and announced he would one day be a politician, not a train driver or coal miners like most of his peers.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Twenty-three years later, he became true to his word as Conservative Member for Rushcliffe, Notts.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His trajectory had been aided by a full scholarship to Nottingham High School — thanks to Rab Butler’s 1944 Education Act (something he insists transformed his whole life) and his uncannily ability to sail through exams.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meanwhile, Ken’s enthusiasm for pubs, clubs, bars and jazz took off the minute some of Nottingham’s more tolerant barmen turned a blind eye.&nbsp;</span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I think she eventually wore her mother’s, or something . . .’ As his career took off — first as a barrister and then, from 1970, as MP for Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire and eternal Cabinet member and Europhile — she abandoned academia to support him and raise their two children, Susan and Ken.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I don’t know why I named him Ken — it was after my father, who’s also Ken, but it’s a bit of a nuisance to have the same name — so we’re ‘Young Ken’ and ‘Old Ken’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meanwhile, ‘Old Ken’ and Gillian couldn’t have been more different.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Whereas he was always calm, thick-skinned and dogged in his determination not to toe the party (or indeed any) line, his wife was private, loyal, protective and ‘somewhat oversensitive’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She once phoned the BBC to complain when comedian Jeremy Hardy made a particularly nasty joke at Ken’s expense.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And she was outraged when the Blairs’ lackeys hounded her out of No. 11 Downing Street (where Clarke had lived as Tory Chancellor) the morning after the 1997 election so Cherie Blair could inspect it in case she preferred it to Number 10. ‘Gillian couldn’t believe they ripped out a perfectly good kitchen.’ But she and Ken adored one another, drove all over the country together to her quilting exhibitions, had long phone conversations whenever they were apart and delighted in vanishing for a month at a time to pursue their tandem hobbies — he scouring the skies for eagles and she ‘upside down in a ditch looking for wild flowers’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They really did vanish. Ken favoured hotels without phones, so that no one could bother them.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Even today he hates to be bothered — at home, work or the Garrick, especially when he’s listening to his jazz albums.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘It is extremely rare for me to pick a phone up at all,’ he says. ‘Unlike most people, if a phone is ringing, I don’t feel the need to answer it.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘It always stops after a minute or so anyway.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He has no computer, iPad or smartphone — just a small Nokia phone which he never turns on because whenever he does, ‘people keep ringing’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He doesn’t use an alarm clock, either, just waking up naturally.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I did briefly have a laptop about five or six years ago,’ he says. ‘I even had a BlackBerry when David [Cameron] got me back on the front bench.’ But he handed them back after about six months.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘They were very useful for the cricket scores but I couldn’t really see any other serious purpose.’ But what about all the documents he has to read, the emails, the letters?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Oh, someone downloads thousands of emails, works out which ones I’d want to read — which are generally all my constituents’ ones and anything from anyone I know — prints them off and brings them round,’ he says.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He must be drowning in paper. ‘I do run my desks on a deep litter system,’ he says cheerily, and adds that he also dictates all his correspondence to two secretaries who take everything down in shorthand.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘They’re old-fashioned methods, but if you’ve got the right people, you can run an office very efficiently using them,’ he insists. ‘It’s too late to change the habits of a life-time and be bothered with all this technology. I’m a public relations man’s nightmare. I don’t do scripted nonsense. I won’t repeat the same slogans over and over. I’m not a wind-up, little talking clock.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>M any say a recent major gaffe gave Theresa May the boost she needed to become Tory leader. The clip of him on Sky News caught off-air this summer, gossiping with colleague Sir Malcolm Rifkind about the Tory leadership ‘fiasco’ after David Cameron had resigned, went viral.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Unaware he was being filmed, Clarke dismissed Michael Gove as a warmonger, Boris Johnson as ‘ridiculous’ and described May ‘a bloody difficult woman . . . but good’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Malcolm and I are a couple of old sweats and to be caught out like that . . . ’ he says today. ‘My office was mortified. How stupid.’ Was it deliberate?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘No . . . I’d have combed my hair first if I’d done it on purpose.’</span></p>&nbsp;I've not gone a single day without a drink since school<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He did look fantastically dishevelled, though.
