If you have oily hair, a <a href=#>product that specifically addresses oily hair problems</a> and controls excessive sebum would be great! Ingredients like salicylic acid work as a mild exfoliator to control excess sebum. Similarly, if you have dry hair, moisturizing components like shea butter, essential oils, and vitamins would work wonders for your hair type. For people with sensitive scalps, it is best to go with a clinically tested dermatologically recommended formula to ensure the best protection.</p><p><strong>b) Ingredients- </strong>When you are looking for a product for your flaky scalp, it is best to look out for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, peppermint oil, citrus extract, menthol, milk protein, and neem, and active ingredients like salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione that target scalp fungus, which causes dandruff in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>c) Texture</strong>- Always look for a product that provides enough moisture to your hair without weighing it down. A lightweight product that provides enough moisturization is what you need to treat your existing problem. It will also prevent buildup in the scalp that further wards off the accumulation of dandruff.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use the Best Anti-dandruff Conditioners?</h2></p><p>Here's how you can effectively use an anti-dandruff conditioner -&nbsp;</p><p>a) First thing first, take your anti-dandruff shampoo and apply it thoroughly on your hair, especially on the roots.</p><p>b) Massage the scalp well with your fingertips or a massager to physically exfoliate the scalp and get rid of any flakiness.</p><p>c) Now wash your hair thoroughly with cold water and squeeze the excess amount of water from your hair.</p><p>d) Take a generous amount of conditioner, and apply it from root to tip on your wet hair. In this step, you can also comb your hair using a wide toothbrush to ensure that the product spreads well into the hair shaft.</p><p>e) Keep the product for about 2-3 minutes before rinsing it off with cold water again.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Gwenda Harmon, Hair Dresser & Curly Hair Specialist - <a href=#>Click for blog</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So, the bottom line is that only an anti-dandruff shampoo isn't enough to combat a dry and itchy scalp!
