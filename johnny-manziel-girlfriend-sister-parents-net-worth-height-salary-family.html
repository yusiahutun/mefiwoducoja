Born and raised amid wealth, Johnny Manziel never lacked anything as a child. He had privileges that millions of children his age would never have in a lifetime. He has won many awards for his outstanding achievements in football and has broken many records that set the pace in American football.

He is currently a free agent.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jade Thirlwall Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Height, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Johnny Manziel Bio</strong></h2><p>Johnny Manziel was born on December 6, 1992, as Jonathan Paul Manziel in Tyler, Texas, the USA, the son of Paul Manziel and Michelle Liberato. His father made his fortune with the Texas oil refinery. Johnny Manziel is of Syrian descent and has American citizenship. He attended Tivy High School in Kerrville, Texas, and even as a young boy in high school he was enthusiastic about sports such as baseball, football, and golf. However, he was advised to stay with football because he had superhero abilities in the sport. Johnny played football for four years in high school. In his junior year, he started playing as a quarterback and finished the season with 2,903 passing yards, 1,544 rushing yards, 152 receiving yards, and 55 touchdowns. This achievement earned him the All-San Antonio Area Offensive Player of the Year award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Johnny-Manziel-Bio.jpg><p>In the senior national team, he far exceeded his previous achievements, and further awards and prizes followed. After high school, he received an athletic scholarship to A&M University, Texas, where he played quarterback for A&M Aggies. He broke records and gained popularity by becoming the first rookie to win the Heisman Trophy. But Johnny couldn’t control his fame as he was constantly getting into trouble and was briefly accused of signing autographs for money in 2013, which led to his suspension.</p><h2><strong>Drug Addiction</strong></h2><p>Johnny’s career went down the drain as fast as it started. He was only able to play two seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Cleveland Browns, who voted him into the 22nd overall NFL Draft 2014. Even though he had everything he could ever wish for, as his parents did everything they could to give him the best life possible, Johnny resorted to hard drugs and became an addict, which broke his parents’ hearts. He was sent to a rehab clinic to address the drug problem and spent 90 days there, but only a few weeks after his return he immediately returned to drugs and parties.</p><h2><strong>Johnny Manziel </strong><strong>Net Worth and Salary</strong></h2><p>Johnny Manziel was voted offensive player of the year in the Antonio area in junior high school. He was twice – back to back – voted offensive player of the year. In 2010 he was awarded the Mr. Texas Football Award. Johnny as quarterback for A&M Aggies was the first rookie and the fifth player in NCAA history to jump 3,000 yards in a season, advancing 1,000 yards. He was awarded the 2012 SEC Freshman Of The Year Award, the Davey O’Brien Award, and the Manning Award. He has played for A&M Aggies Texas and Cleveland Browns and although there is no concrete figure for his net worth, it is estimated to be around $4 to $6 million.</p><h2><strong>Family, Parents, Sister</strong></h2><p>johnny Manziel’s ancestors were immigrants to the United States of America from Lebanon Mountain. Joseph Manziel, the great-great-grandfather of Johnny Manziel, came to the USA in 1883 to survive. His son, Bobby Joe Manziel, who was a bantamweight boxer at the time, retired from boxing and decided to move to Texas to start a new life. He started drilling for oil and became a great success. Today his children and grandchildren still live on what he left them and continue to be in the oil business. Johnny’s grandfather and other relatives have long been charged with drug offenses, robbery, and alcohol consumption.</p><p>Johnny Manziel’s younger sister, Meri, was born in 1995. The two siblings are similar in many ways and have the same hobbies, namely shopping and sports. They even take fashion tips and criticism from each other. Meri studies economics and hopes to become a buyer at Neiman Marcus.</p><h2><strong>Is Johnny Manziel Married? Girlfriend</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Johnny-Manziel-and-Breana-Tiesi.jpg><p>Johnny Manziel got engaged in March 2017 to his only a few months old model girlfriend Breana Tiesi. He publicly affirmed that she inspired him to return to football after a long break, and proposed to her on her trip to Paris with a bouquet and a diamond ring.</p><p>Breana was recently the victim of a dogfight in her neighborhood. When she told the event to her followers on Instagram, she said that a strange dog came into her house and her two dogs felt threatened by his presence and launched an attack on him; while trying to separate them, one of the dogs bit her lips and left him hanging. The injury was sutured by a plastic surgeon whom she called.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tony Berlin Biography, Net Worth, Married, Wife, Children, Facts</a></strong></p><p>Johnny had been involved with other women before Breana. In 2013, he dated American actress, Sarah Savage&nbsp;and model Lauren Hanley between&nbsp;2013 and 2014. He then dated Colleen Crowley in 2015. In November 2016, Johnny was accused of domestic violence by Colleen which signaled the end of their relationship. However, he was sent to take an anger management course on account of the accusation.</p><h2><strong>What Is His Height?</strong></h2><p>Johnny Manziel is 6ft (183 cm) tall.
