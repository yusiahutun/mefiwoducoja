He graduated from high school in 1997 and went on to attend community college but dropped out in the first semester before moving to Maui, Hawaii, where he lived in a van and a tent on the beach. “It’s a pretty awesome place to be homeless. We just drank and smoked weed and worked minimal hours, just enough to cover gas, food, and fishing supplies,” he told the Independent in a past interview. While working as a waiter at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in Maui, Pratt was discovered by actress and director Rae Dawn Chong who cast him in her directorial debut, Cursed Part 3. The short film led to other acting jobs, such as the role as Harold Brighton “Bright” Abbott on the TV show Everwood and Winchester “Ché” Cook on The OC.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Pratt’s breakthrough role came in 2009 when he played Andy Dwyer in NBC’s Parks and Recreation. Originally meant to be a guest star, the producers liked Pratt so much they promoted him to a series regular. His next big break came in 2014 when he was cast as Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. The success of the series led Pratt to star as the lead of other action movies like the <a href=# rel=noopener>Jurassic World franchise</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>The Tomorrow War.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Parks-and-Recreation.jpg><p>In an interview on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in 2016, Pratt opened up about what it was like to find success later in life.&nbsp;“[Fame] messes with you regardless probably. I feel bad for kids who get famous really young,” Pratt said at the time. “It’s important to make your mistakes in relative obscurity so you can say, ‘Wow shouldn’t have done that. I’m going to distance myself. Move on. Become a better person.’ You can really be defined by the mistakes you make.” Pratt, who was married to his <a href=# rel=noopener>ex-wife Anna Faris</a> at the time, also told Colbert about what it was like to be married to someone who was much more famous than he was.</p><p>“We’ve been together about nine years, but no one really knew who I was and she was a big movie star and people knew her. It was nice for me to see how people treated her that were in her life,” he said. “That was a good lesson for me coming into this the last couple years of my life because you start to realize you that you can be surrounded by people that are going to be deferential and ‘yes men.’ It taught me some important lessons.”</p><p>So what is <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Pratt’s net worth</a> and how much does he make from the Jurassic World and the Guardians of the Galaxy movies?
