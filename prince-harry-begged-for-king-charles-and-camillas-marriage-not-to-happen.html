<time>30 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Prince Harry’s feelings over King Charles and Camilla’s marriage may have brought a tear to many royal fans’ eyes when reading his memoir.</strong></p><p>The Duke of Sussex pleaded with his father, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, before he tied the knot with his second wife, but claimed it fell on deaf ears. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> wrote about their relationship after his mother passed away in his memoir Spare, which released in January 2023. The royal opened up about his childhood, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s death and meeting the love of his life in the biography which he divulged his private thoughts with a ghostwriter. The monarch’s marriage with <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a> began 19 years ago, after being in a relationship for years prior, and Prince Harry was uneasy about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-pleaded-with-king-charles-over-his-marriage-to-camilla>Prince Harry pleaded with King Charles over his marriage to Camilla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-455180594-1024x680.jpg><p>The memoir, which ended up beating Barack Obama’s biography, debuted a number of private moments from within The Firm’s inner circle.</p><p>The 39-year-old revealed many parts of his life growing up, including the <a href=#>death of his mother Diana</a> and his turbulent bond with brother Prince William.</p><p>But Prince Harry also divulged his feelings about King Charles’ marriage to Camilla, who would become his second wife.</p><p>The monarch divorced their mother, Diana, in 1996, following years of the couple being separated. Afterward, news of Charles’ affair with Camilla Parker Bowles came to light.</p><p>But at the time, the Duke says he and William were supportive of his new love, but had one request.</p><p>He wrote: “When the question came, Willy and I promised our father that we would welcome Camilla to the family.</p><p>“The only thing we asked for in return was that he didn’t marry her. ‘You don’t need to get married again,’ we asked him”.</p><p>However, the couple have now been married for 19 years, saying I Do in April 2005. <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> did not attend the civil ceremony, but did go to the reception and pose for photographs for the joyous occasion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-s-remarks-in-his-memoir>Prince’s remarks in his memoir</h2><p>Harry and William haven’t spoken about their feelings about Camilla officially, but the dad-of-two did write more about his stepmother in his memoir. Insiders from the palace has said it hasn’t gone down well with His Majesty and the rest of the palace.</p><p>But Harry has published many stories for his memoir, which may have escalated tension within The Firm.</p><p>He says he wondered if she would be cruel to him “like all the wicked stepmothers in storybooks,” but did not say she was. It was more trying to imagine what life would be to have your father marry again.</p><p>But he alleged 42-year-old William had “suspicions” about the ‘Other Woman’, and that the Queen Consort renovated his bedroom into a dressing room when he moved out at age 28.</p><p>The prince claimed the Queen Consort wanted to change how the public perceived her following Diana.</p><p>When being interviewed by Tom Bradby to plug his book, he accused the royals of leaking stories to the press.</p><p>He wrote in his biography Charles and Camilla’s ‘spin doctor’ threw him ‘under the bus’ and leaked news of his drug use in 2002.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-called-camilla-the-villain>Harry called Camilla the ‘villain’</h2><p>Going further, Harry, married to <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, described Camilla after her marriage to King Charles as ‘the villain’. He said she was the ‘third person in the marriage,’ which was eerily similar to how his mother Diana referred to the <a href=#>royal</a> during her infamous interview in 1995.</p><p>He wrote: “I had complex feelings about gaining a stepparent who, I believed, had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar.</p><p>“In a funny way I even wanted Camilla to be happy. Maybe she’d be less dangerous if she was happy?”</p><p>The palace, nor individual members of the family, have responded to the claims in his book.</p><p>He appeared to try to bury the hatchet when <a href=#>speaking to Good Morning America</a>, where he said he had a “huge amount of compassion for her”.</p><p>Harry, dad to Prince <a href=#>Archie and Princess Lilibet</a>, clarified: “She’s my stepmother. I don’t look at her as an evil stepmother.</p><p>“I see someone who married into this institution and has done everything that she can to improve her own reputation and her own image for her own sake.”</p><p>That may have helped some of the awkward passages. But he may not receive a Christmas Card for a few years.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z9cLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaZnp%2BXmrFuss6rZKShnpx6pLTAq6Oeq12Wu6V5wpqkoqSclsBuucCrqaKZl5p6r7vTZquoZZiWvbGxzWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-begged-for-king-charles-and-camillas-marriage-not-to-happen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./diary-memo-record-diaries-in-the-form-of-videos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./diary-memo-record-diaries-in-the-form-of-videos.html>Record Diaries in the Form of Videos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./melanie-griffith-strips-underwear-instagram-photos.html>Melanie Griffith, 63, STUNS fans by stripping to underwear for candid photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./melanie-griffith-strips-underwear-instagram-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
