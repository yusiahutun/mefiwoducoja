One such significant development in plant genetics has been the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies among others. These technologies are being used to develop new crops that are more productive, nutritious, and resilient to pests, diseases, and climate change.</p><p>As a result, they have the potential to help to feed a growing global population and to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. In addition to this, there are a number of other areas of research that are showing promise. Scientists are also developing new ways to use plant viruses to deliver genes to plants. They are also exploring the use of synthetic biology to create new plant-based products.</p><p>These advancements have sparked a surge in both corporate interest and capacity to deliver high-quality biological products to the agricultural industry. <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>AgBio Logic LLC</a></strong> has been consistently providing top-tier products for crop production for over three decades from its base in South Carolina, USA. Since its establishment in 1991, Jerry O’Dell, co-founder and owner of AgBio Logic LLC, has been actively cultivating a biological biostimulant market tailored to the needs of the United States.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biostimulants: The Hidden Gem&nbsp;</h2><p>Biostimulants can be best defined as substances and/or microorganisms, according to the European Biostimulant Industry Council. When these substances are applied to plants or soil, their primary function is to stimulate natural processes that enhance nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, abiotic stress tolerance, and overall crop quality.</p><p>AgBio Logic’s significant impact in the biostimulant sector largely stems from its early years of conducting field trials for various vegetables and crops. O’Dell says, “During the initial decade, we focused on securing research trials for a range of crops, most of which were carried out by land grant universities in the Southeastern region of the United States. The products used in these trials were a combination of seaweed extracts, humic acids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash, as well as macro and micronutrients.”</p><p>In 1997, collaborative studies were initiated with Dr. Ronnie Heiniger, a cropping systems specialist from North Carolina State University. These studies involved soybeans, wheat, and corn. Among the findings, the most impressive results were observed in corn, where a product applied in a 2×2 configuration with starter fertilizer at planting led to significant yield increases.&nbsp;</p><p>AgBio Logic actively sought out corn farmers who were already implementing precision farming practices and using yield monitor technology. These farmers served as valuable partners in assessing the return on investment associated with incorporating biostimulants as part of their input strategies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A New Paradigm in Farming</h2><p>According to O’Dell, utilizing biostimulant products with diverse modes of action and a variety of substances and microorganisms can lead to a higher and more consistent return on investment (ROI) than relying on a single form of substance or microorganism. This sets AgBio Logic products apart from most others available in the U.S. Notably, there is a growing trend in products that incorporate multiple biostimulants.</p><p>The company’s initial product featured a blend of humic acids sourced from leonardite ore and a seaweed extract produced by a Norwegian company. Since then, AgBio Logic has developed numerous formulations. The company’s flagship soil-applied product, Start Right 2.0, combines multiple biostimulants in a single product.&nbsp;</p><p>It consists of a mix of nutrients sequestered within a concentrated carboxylates blend, which mimics the secretions of beneficial soil microbes. This unique carboxylic acid aids in plant growth and reproduction in numerous ways such as reducing physiological stress caused by phosphate bound calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, and excess sodium. This formulation is further enriched with fermented plant extracts, amino acids, ten essential plant vitamins, extracts from Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed, and sixteen carefully selected soil bacteria.&nbsp;</p><p>With the introduction of this flagship product, AgBio Logic has reached new heights in the field of biostimulants. In recognition of its outstanding contributions, the company was honored as the Top Agri Biotech Company of 2022 by Agri Business Review. This accolade underscores their commitment to innovation and excellence in the agricultural biotechnology sector.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Enhancing Crop Performance with Specialized Solutions</h2><p>Start Right 2.0 has firmly established its reputation as a standout product, gaining the coveted endorsement of a prominent seed company. Its proven efficacy shines most brightly in the heart of the American agricultural landscape—the Midwestern states, renowned as the corn belt.&nbsp;</p><p>Operating within the overarching framework of the company’s esteemed foliar product line, known as ‘Over The Top,’ each offering undergoes a meticulous formulation process tailored to the precise needs of various crops. Take, for instance, the exemplary ‘Over The Top Soybeans D.S.’ This dry-soluble solution stands as a testament to the company’s commitment to excellence.&nbsp;</p><p>Infused with the power of carboxylic acid and seaweed extract, it boasts a nutrient profile with 6-0-18 ratio of nitrogen, and potassium. Moreover, this exceptional blend includes an extensive array of macro and micronutrients such as magnesium, sulfur, boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, ensuring that crops receive the vital elements necessary for their optimal growth and development.</p><p>“Agricultural innovation is the key.”</p><p>AgBio Logic’s commitment to tailored solutions and proven products shines brightly. Its dedication to addressing the unique demands of various crops underscores its role as an industry leader. As it continues to pave the way for sustainable and efficient farming practices, AgBio Logic stands at the forefront of agricultural advancement, empowering farmers across the corn belt and beyond to achieve bountiful harvests and drive the future of agriculture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Triumphing Over Industry Challenges</h2><p>As a pioneer in collecting data from field studies involving a blend of biostimulants and other essential nutrients, O’Dell faced considerable challenges in establishing a market for biological practices in crop production. He says, “The realization of the importance of educating all sectors within the agricultural industry about the benefits of biostimulants became my central focus.”&nbsp;</p><p>He encountered discouragement due to the limited interest from agricultural product suppliers, their limited knowledge of the chemistry involved, and the reluctance of many in the scientific community to engage in field trials. Even today, some of these challenges persist.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, he and other companies have taken it upon themselves to conduct their own studies, collaborating with farmers who employ precision farming practices. This effort remains an ongoing endeavor, but biological use has emerged as the fastest-growing segment within the crop inputs industry.
