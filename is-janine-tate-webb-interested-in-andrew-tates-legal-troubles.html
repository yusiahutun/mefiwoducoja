<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Janine Tate Webb might be the younger sister of Andrew Tate, but she seems to want no part in his legal troubles.</strong></p><p>Janine Tate Webb lives estranged from her two brothers, Andrew and Tristan Tate. Andrew Tate III is a well-known British-American figure. He is a former professional kickboxer and social media personality.</p><p>He rose to fame after appearing on the British reality show Big Brother. Andrew has a website where he offers paid courses and memberships, promoting an “ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle.” However, his controversial comments and behavior resulted in his suspension from several social media platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Andrew_Tates_Legal_Troubles></span>Andrew Tate’s Legal Troubles<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In December 2022, the Romanian police arrested Andrew and his brother Tristan, along with two ladies. They were accused of trafficking women and creating paid pornography for social media. The brothers were in detention for three months. Upon their release, they were placed under house arrest pending the conclusion of the investigation.</p><p>Interestingly, Andrew’s sister Janine Tate Webb is a successful lawyer. However, Andrew seems to have an estranged relationship with her. He is unsure where she lives and has expressed reluctance to ask her to help with his legal troubles. Also, Janine seems to want no part in Andrew’s controversial case.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Andrew’s rise to fame and success couldn’t be more different from that of his sister. While he has gained attention by sharing his life and views online, Janine lives in Kentucky out of the public eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/279232772_10166133830725632_6294829692440825625_n.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Janine_Tate_Webb></span>Who Is Janine Tate Webb?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Janine Tate Webb is the younger sister of the famous kickboxer and businessman Andrew Tate. She was born on March 2, 1992, to the late American chess grandmaster Emory Andrew Tate Jr. and Eileen Tate.&nbsp;</p><p>When Janine was five years old, her parents divorced. After their marriage ended, Janine’s mother returned to England with her three children. They settled in a council estate in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, close to some of their relatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being the sister of a well-known public figure, Janine made a name for herself in the legal industry. Also, she has notable achievements, such as making the 2019 Super Lawyers Rising Stars list.&nbsp;Her impressive career shows that she is not just defined by her family name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Janine_Tate_Webbs_Rising_Legal_Career></span>Janine Tate Webb’s Rising Legal Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Undoubtedly, Janine Tate Webb comes from a family of successful individuals. But she carved her path to success through her passion and hard work. Her decision to keep her life private allowed her to focus on her career and interests.</p><p>As mentioned, Janine is a highly accomplished lawyer. She earned her degree from the prestigious J David Rosenberg College of Law at the University of Kentucky. Her impressive legal skills and dedication to justice made her a top lawyer in her field.</p><p>Before getting listed in the 2019 Super Lawyers Rising Stars list, she won the 2015 Best Oral Advocate award from the Legal Research and Writing Club. Additionally, Janine is a National Bar Association, John Rowe Chapter, Lexington, KY member, and she became part of the Kentucky Bar Association in 2017.</p><p>Janine focuses on Healthcare and Insurance Defense. She’s a respected figure in the legal community, and her impressive track record speaks for itself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Janine_Married></span>Is Janine Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/285183025_10166278593875632_2468160840880917957_n-768x1024.jpg><p>Janine is happily married with a son to Norman Webb, a bodybuilder, fitness enthusiast, and nutritionist. Janine took on her husband’s surname after their wedding, hence her name, Janine Tate Webb.</p><p>The couple share a passion for health and wellness, evident in their personal and professional lives. Norman holds a doctorate in physical therapy from the University of Kentucky, and he lives in Lexington with Janine and their son.&nbsp;</p><p>Janine has an estimated net worth of $300,000. She may not be as wealthy as her siblings Andrew ($700 million) and Tristan ($350 million), but she is building her net worth with her work in the legal field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/276038363_10166055229625632_4601188882566414149_n-768x1024.jpg><p>From all indications, Janine will stay away from the spotlight and her brothers’ scandal. This puts her on the long list of celebrity relatives who stay away from the limelight. A classic example is <a href=#>Edward Ortega</a>, the father of Netflix’s “Wednesday” lead actress, Jenna Ortega.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5yZqloqaVYsGiwMRmrp6akmK2r8DEq5ysrJWZeqq6jJqlnaqVrHq1rdOeqmaklZyurXnTq6aumpyawHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-janine-tate-webb-interested-in-andrew-tates-legal-troubles.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./schoolgirl-15-suffered-epilepsy-chronic-pain-died-drugs-overdose-intended-kill-says-coroner-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./schoolgirl-15-suffered-epilepsy-chronic-pain-died-drugs-overdose-intended-kill-says-coroner-html.html>Manchester girl with epilepsy who died with drugs overdose 'intended to kill herself'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beth-dillon-and-paul-teutul-sr.html>Beth Dillon and Paul Teutul Sr.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beth-dillon-and-paul-teutul-sr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
