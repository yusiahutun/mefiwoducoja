He describes himself as a prophet, a student of the word of God, an <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/396087-10-kenyan-writers-reading-now.html href=#>author</a>, and a recording artist.</p><p class=align-left>On September 11, 1989, Brian was born in Jacksonville, Florida, USA, where he also grew up. His parents are Brian Carn Senior and Andrea Carn, and he has a sister called Keaundra Nickelberry. Further details of his childhood and upbringing are not in the public domain. However, he was likely raised in a Christian home.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>There has been no information in public concerning the prophet's early <a href=#>education</a> or <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/278134-20-best-colleges-kenya-2021-notable-institutions.html href=#>college</a> degrees. However, it is likely that Carn attended and completed primary and high school successfully.</p><h3>Ministry</h3><p class=align-left>Brian received the gift of salvation at the tender age of eight years. He then began to focus all his attention on <a id=https://www.kncb.org/2015/10/05/prophet-brian-carn/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">preaching</a> the gospel. When Carn was 12 years old, he organized a three-day pentecostal revival meeting which was intense and impactful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a1c83012c4c607.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Percy Gibson: Net worth, nationality, career, wedding, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The young servant of God was desperate to see the fire of God return to the local church with signs, wonders, and miracles. He longed for a purifying and prophetic move of God among his people. This zeal saw Brian embark on an 88-day prayer and fasting period.</p><p class=align-left>After this time in prayer, God led him to a Florida crusade where Benny Hinn was ministering. Hinn prophesied a duplicate but double receipt of his anointing and mantle on Brian.</p><p class=align-left>This prophecy changed the course of Carn's life, and years later, he was invited to minister alongside Pastor Benny Hinn at Worldwide Christian Faith crusades. He has also ministered alongside several other <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/314572-top-15-richest-pastors-world.html href=#>pastors</a> in the course of his ministry.</p><p class=align-left>Brian's ministry saw him tour numerous American states. In 2006, he visited the Old Dominion State of Virginia. The Sunday morning service where he was speaking turned into another 3-night revival meeting. The three nights prolonged even further and became 10 weeks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e6dd275c55bf3df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bob Barker from The Price Is Right: net worth, wife, children, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Other notable experiences include the opening of blind eyes, the healing of cancer, and individuals receiving the gift of salvation.
