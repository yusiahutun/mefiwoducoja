The same goes for nice brickwork or old ornamental woodwork. Or maybe you don't want to commit to a particular location for your camera. Many of the mount suggestions we highlight below aren't just no-drill, they're also extremely easy to move to a new location.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So whether it pains your wallet in fear of a deposit lost or your pride in terms of keeping your home's exterior in mint condition, you can skip the drilling and use these alternative methods to mount your smart security cameras.</p><h2 id=you-can-tape-just-about-anything>You Can Tape Just About Anything</h2><p>All things considered, smart security cameras are really light. Just like with <a href=#>smart home video doorbells</a>, you can use quality mounting tape to secure them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Can I Use Mounting Tape for My Video Doorbell?</a></span></p><p>If you're mounting the camera indoors, you can get away with using a less aggressive tape, as it won't need to withstand the elements. Indoors you might find <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">large 3M Command tape strips</a> to be sufficient to hold the camera mount in place, though we would certainly recommend testing it out first with something soft for the camera to fall onto should the tape fail (a laundry basket with a pillow in it should do the trick).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outdoors, while you could try <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">outdoor-rated 3M command tape strips</a>, the gold standard for seriously sturdy outdoor tape-based mounting is <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">3M's Very High Bond (VHB) tape</a>. If it's good enough for RVers to secure solar panels to the roof of their RV, then it's definitely good enough to stick a camera weighing a few ounces to your house.</p><p>Mounting a smart camera with tape is much easier if the existing mounting base has a relatively flat and smooth surface. If the base that came with your camera is intended to be screwed to the wall, it may have a lot of empty space and a rib-style hollow cavity that offers little surface area for the tape to find purchase.</p><p>You may find you need to seek out a third-party base. In some cases, you can even find bases intended to be taped or, like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">this magnetic mount for Arlo cameras</a>, that already come with a disc of 3M VHB tape in the kit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The downside of taping, of course, is that you have to get the tape off without damaging the surface. And even if you don't damage the surface, you'll need to loosen the adhesive and clean it off somehow---which is exactly why the specialty mounts in the next section are so appealing.</p><h2 id=use-specialty-mounts-for-gutters-doors-and-more>Use Specialty Mounts for Gutters, Doors, and More</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NoDrillSmartCameraMount2.jpg><p>A significant number of the smart home cameras on the market, including those from Arlo, Blink, Eufy, Ring, and Wyze, use a standard screw mount hole.</p><p>That screw mount hole will be familiar to any photographer as it uses the 1/4-20 mount screw found on tripods---it's 1/4th inch in diameter and has 20 thread turns per inch of length.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This makes shopping for mounting accessories really easy. You can still search for specific brand names if you prefer, but as soon as you identify whether or not your particular camera brand uses the standard "photography" mount, you're in business, and you can buy any mount---of the hundreds and hundreds that support it---on the market. You could even put the smart home camera right on an actual tripod, for that matter.</p><p>Let's take a look at a variety of smart camera mounts that take advantage of this compatibility.</p><h3 id=gutters>Gutters</h3><p>Gutters are a pretty convenient place to mount a smart camera. They're sturdy, project out from the house, and the lip makes it super easy to attach a mounting bracket.</p><p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">This gutter mount bracket kit</a> is a great value and includes both a 1/4-20 screw mount as well as an included flat-plate that attaches to the screw mount. So you can either screw the camera directly into the post or use <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">VHB tape</a> to attach it to the plate if there is no mount point on your camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>[buy url="Wassertein Smart Camera Gutter Mounts" award="" summary="These clever little brackets make it easy to mount a wide number of smart cameras right on the lip of your gutters." title="https://www.amazon.com/Wasserstein-Gutter-Mount-Reolink-Compatible-Panels/dp/B07KHXD58X/"]Buy</p><p>It's also quite useful for mounting camera accessories like a solar panel charging kit, like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Ring Solar Panel</a>, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Arlo Solar Panel Charger</a>, or one of the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">many third-party solar panels</a>, if you want to position the camera in one place and the solar panel in a sunnier place nearby.</p><p>If you plan on putting the camera and solar panel in the same location, however, you might be more interested in <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">this 2-in-1 mount</a> that includes two mounting points on one bracket.</p><h3 id=doors>Doors</h3><p>Sometimes you're really limited with where you can attach a no-drill mount. If you're in an apartment with no gutters handy and you want to avoid sticking a patch of VHB tape to the communal wall outside your apartment, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">a door mount</a> might be in order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31g-ag14tcl-_sl500_-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Wassertein Smart Camera Door Mount</h5>$17 <span class=regular-price>$20</span> Save $3<p class=display-card-description>Some people hang decorations off the top of their door, and now you can hang a security camera.
