My mum is a down-to-earth M&S woman, but when you see your daughter at death's door and all these physicians say there is nothing they can do, you will do anything.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She had clearly suffered a serious trauma, developing septicaemia after her daughter Zarah was born in one of London's leading private hospitals in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The whole birth was traumatic. I'd had pre-eclampsia and it was an emergency.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They tried to give an epidural, but it didn't work so I had a general, but when the baby came out she was floppy. I didn't even see her for 24 hours and was at the point of thinking, 'Is my baby even alive? Are they lying to me?' '</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was convinced there was something wrong with herself afterwards – 'I felt so bad I thought I was going to die.

That's it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was dyslexic, so perhaps formal academic success was going to be tricky, but was there any hint of entrepreneurial zeal at school? She laughs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At careers fairs, everyone else was being told, 'Oh, be a doctor or a solicitor,' but when it got to me they said it was doubtful if I'd even get in to secretarial college.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They did actually say to me – 'Lucy, you're going to have to marry well.' '</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She and her husband, Simon, who had experience with tech companies, remortgaged their London home to start Lyma Life, going into partnership first with Professor Clayton, then other doctors who work in the field of degenerative disease and preventative care.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Where did the name come from? 'Lyma means 'the origin' or 'the source' in ancient Greek, and that kind of struck me because we were using ingredients that were sourced from thousands of years ago.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The business philosophy was bang up to date, though. She cites the beauty entrepreneur Jo Malone as an inspiration.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She took a functional item, a candle, and turned it into a lifestyle statement for the home. Adding that 'brand' element was essential.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Other influences were 'Tom Ford, Apple and Nike – all lifestyle brands'. So hello Lyma – not simply a load of vitamins and supplements in a pot, but a lifestyle choice.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This was where Lucy's PR background proved perhaps the key ingredient. She had worked with department stores so had experience of the luxury market.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also understood the power of celebrity, so when Lyma supplements were first launched, they were sent to various famous women to try.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first social media endorsement ('and no, we didn't pay her') came from singer Ellie Goulding.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As soon as Goulding raved about how wonderful the product was, they were inundated with people asking to be part of the Lyma experience.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first product was the supplements, but then came some exciting news from Germany, where Dr Clayton had been observing the effects of low-level laser treatments in elderly patients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They'd been using it to rebuild cartilage, but while the other doctors were looking at X-rays, he was struck by the skin on the man's knees. On the one that had been treated, it looked 20 years younger.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lucy sat up. Within months she was trying out a hand-held laser torch herself on her knees. 'They looked like a 90-year-old's knees. I'd sit at night, using the laser on them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After a month I thought 'Is this working?' but after eight weeks, I compared pictures and, oh my God, I looked like I'd had a knee lift. I'd found our next product.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She is almost evangelical about this laser. 'I knew we had the power to transform the whole industry.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What industry, though? This is a relatively new world, straddling the health supplement industry, the cosmetic industry and the almighty lifestyle brand.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The company literature strives to distance Lyma from traditional supplements, stressing the 'science'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is much talk of things like 'epigenetic breakthroughs' and 'bioavailability'. The supplements include things such as turmeric extract, Vitamin D, Smart Nootropic (said to improve cognitive function) and ashwagandha root, commonly used to combat stress. Is this piffle?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Well there is peer-reviewed research to suggest that some of these supplements do have health benefits, but little to back up claims.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The skincare industry is much more highly regulated than the supplement one, though, and a research paper into this side will be published later this year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Preliminary findings on Lyma products' efficacy have delighted Lucy. 'It works! It works!' she says. 'It's in a completely different league to anything else out there.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Whatever, you can see why customers – especially perimenopausal women, the core target – are tempted. The promise of sleep, calm AND glossy skin?&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Take my credit card now. But isn't this exploitative?&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It would be if it didn't work,' says Lucy. But her own lifestyle suggests that the Lyma experience is not a quick route to being on top of your own life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For her well-being is a much wider concept. She rises to warm water with a slice of lemon and then heads to the gym.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She eats a non-processed food diet, rarely drinks alcohol, likes to sit cross-legged and be at one with her thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gwynnie could probably come and stay and feel quite at home, I imagine.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Has she met Gwynnie. Meghan et al? 'I've met a lot of people,' she smiles.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Is the celeb skin as good up close? 'I think Gwyneth looks absolutely amazing.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We love Gywnnie, but she can seem smug. Lucy insists her feet are definitely on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm from Leeds, for crying out loud. You can't get more real. Anyway, I don't think it is smug because what I'm saying is all this is hard work. If you want to be super-human, you also have to pay attention to your diet, to exercise, sleep.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the midst of building a business empire, Lucy had a second child, this time by IVF.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Zach has just turned one, but Lucy has spent the first year of his life jet-setting across the Atlantic to build her brand.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yes, she knows about working parent guilt. Her own miracle products may help her live her high-octane life, but there are limits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;'They don't look after the children,' she says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she does launch the product that will sort out childcare as well as crepey necks, world domination will be hers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2Ra2xtbWBmfI6706Gcq2WkrLxusMiem2afmau2r7OMm6CrrJhiuaay02aqnKCfpLlus9Gam55ldah6tLHLpapmbWBleqetwp5knKqVlrpvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmother-two-died-giving-birth-left-school-grade-es-sells-500-face-cream-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./widower-wins-4m-in-medical-malpractice-suit-against-genesis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./widower-wins-4m-in-medical-malpractice-suit-against-genesis.html>Widower wins $4M in medical malpractice suit against Genesis</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./man-arrested-cutting-brake-line-girlfriends-car-html.html>Man arrested over cutting brake line on girlfriend's car</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./man-arrested-cutting-brake-line-girlfriends-car-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
