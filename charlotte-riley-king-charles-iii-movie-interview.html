In King Charles III, a 90-minute TV adaptation of Mike Bartlett's Tony-nominated play (airing tonight at 9 PM EST on Masterpiece on PBS), the 35-year-old English actress plays the Duchess of Cambridge, dutiful partner of Prince William, doting mother to George and Charlotte—and quiet revolutionary within the royal family after the newly-crowned Charles III creates a governmental crisis. Written in blank verse, the play positions Charles, Camilla, William, Kate and Harry as actors in a Shakespearean drama grappling with the fallout of the new monarch's well-intentioned yet disastrous choices after Queen Elizabeth II's death. "The pressure was to give enough of a nod towards these people that the audience would follow us on this journey," says Riley of the challenge of playing living celebrities in "completely fictional" circumstances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Riley's Kate reveals an unexpected resourcefulness under the remote, smiling exterior we're accustomed to with the real Duchess of Cambridge; motivated by the need to keep her children's once-secure future from crumbling, this Catherine refuses to stand by as the monarchy collapses. She devises a plan to help her husband secure the throne once and for all—something she gleefully reveals to viewers in a powerful, fourth-wall breaking speech that'll make you think the real Duchess of Cambridge is speaking to you from the screen. (Riley is quick to point out, though, that real Kate and fictional Kate "have the same name, but essentially, they're two quite different people.")</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>Below, Riley discusses creating her own version of Kate Middleton for King Charles III, the surreality of being crowned queen and returning to the new season of Peaky Blinders.<span></span></p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On her first reaction to Mike Bartlett's take on the British royal family:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It used to be a play, and I had read through the script a couple of years ago. I didn't get to see the actual theater production because it was always sold out and I couldn't get tickets. I was really excited to read the screenplay version; I was on holiday at the time, [and] it was kind of weird reading this dark, futuristic, Shakespearean history-type screenplay somewhere where you're in bikini chilling out [laughs]. I read it and I was like, 'This is fucking genius!' It was so clever, and Mike's script is so astute, witty, brilliantly executed, and the characters are so brilliantly observed. It takes what we know about the royal family and turns it on its head, because it's set in the future. It's not real, it's absolutely fiction, and he pushes those characters to their limits and really takes the lid off their public personas. What would these people be like under these types of circumstances, and in private?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I read the script and was like, if I was to ever play Kate Middleton, that's the version of Kate Middleton I would want to play. She's feisty and strong and opinionated and intelligent and clever and all the things that she is, I assume, in real life—but perhaps we don't get to see that side of her at the moment."</p><img alt="Sitting, Room, Event, Photography, Leisure, Family, Interior design, Family pictures, House, " title="Sitting, Room, Event, Photography, Leisure, Family, Interior design, Family pictures, House, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-charles-iii-1494801113.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Masterpiece on PBS</span><p>Charlotte Riley as Kate with, clockwise from top left, Richard Goulding (Prince Harry), Oliver Chris (Prince William), Margot Leicester (Camilla) and Tim Pigott-Smith (King Charles)</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On crafting her own interpretation of the Duchess of Cambridge:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We were teasing Richard Goulding [who plays Prince Harry] at the Q&A the other day because he was like, 'Yeah I didn't really research the character.' We were all calling him a lazy actor, but that wasn't his reasoning at all. He just went purely with Mike's version of the character. For me, Kate Middleton (as the public figure we know) wasn't hugely on my radar. She's followed because of what she wears and things like that and I just hadn't really followed that. So I thought, I need to understand the public's perception of her. I did a lot of research on YouTube and watched endless and endless amounts of clips of her, of people's mobile phone footage of meeting her. You can watch all the interviews, but you just don't see these people in their private moments. You can watch those for the way she dresses and the way she holds herself publicly, but then, at the end of the day, like Richard, you have to let that go and follow Mike Bartlett's characters and the text. At some point, you have to jump into the imaginary realm. The Kate that we see [in real life] and the Kate [from the play], they have the same name, but essentially they're two quite different people."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><br>"She's feisty and strong and opinionated and intelligent and clever and all the things that she is, I assume, in real life—but perhaps we don't get to see that side of her at the moment."<br><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On the challenges of playing a living, widely-known public figure:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For me, it was just personal nerves about it. At some point, you have to let go of what an important figure they are and just play the minutiae of what's happening for that person in their life. I'm assuming [the Duchess] is not walking around thinking, 'I'm Kate Middleton, I have to act [like] this.' For sure there are social pressures of how she needs to act, but once you've taken that on, it's [about] getting on with what the character's doing and living in each scene. You just crack on as you would with any other character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"What we all tried to do is not impersonate these people. We each chose slightly different things, whether it was a vocal thing or, obviously, we gave a nod to her hair and her fashion. With the [other] characters, [it was] certain ways they held their hands. The brilliant Tim Pigott-Smith [who played Charles] had certain vocal things he did that allowed the audience to be able to click into the character, so they can go, 'I'm bringing all my knowledge of who that person is with me, and now I'm going on this journey with Mike Bartlett's version of this character.' The pressure was to give enough of a nod to these people that the audience would follow us on this journey."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"It takes what we know about the royal family and turns it on its head... What would these people be like under these types of circumstances, and in private?" <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On Kate's trajectory in the play:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think in the context of the play, you see a journey for Catherine. She goes from still slightly the outsider and observing, watching, learning how everything works–and she and William are very much working and supporting the family—until the fallout of Charles's choices. Then you literally see her blossom and come into her own. I see her like the CEO of a company. She steps up and she's like, 'Guys. This can't happen.' She brings William into his power and says, 'You have to take control of the situation because this is going to change British history as we know it if you don't.' You see her going from observing and watching to making some really, really bold decisions."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On the Shakespearean nature of the drama:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The language helps people immediately suspend their disbelief and [shows] that this is not a sketch. This is not a piss-take of the royal family. I think that language just slightly separates the situation from reality, it just heightens it. It allows the audience to go along with the fictionalization of the whole thing. I don't know about you, but after five minutes of watching it, you almost forget about the language, and that's what's really beautiful about it. And then going in and out of verse and prose, so you've got Harry having an experience [where] civilization's all torn up afterward and it's all in prose, and then in the royal chambers it's verse again, as it often is in Shakespeare. I think that works as brilliantly now as it did back for Shakespeare."</p><img alt="Hair, Clothing, Premiere, Hairstyle, Beauty, Fashion, Shoulder, Electric blue, Lip, Carpet, " title="Hair, Clothing, Premiere, Hairstyle, Beauty, Fashion, Shoulder, Electric blue, Lip, Carpet, " width=1000 height=1557 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-charlotte-riley-1494801003.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Riley on the red carpet in March</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On breaking the fourth wall:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There wouldn't have been a royal family without her pushing William to step up. That soliloquy goes a long way to explain her actions. I think it's probably one of the most interesting points in the play. She actively challenges their perception of her: 'You think I'm just some Barbie doll, eye candy. Fine, you can have that perception of me. Take it. I'm willingly giving it to you, but if you have me in that way, then I will use that power for something else, because I'm not just that. I'm much, much more than that.' I think it's her way of explaining what's about to happen. 'I am of this time, you can have me. You can consume me in that way. But whilst you're doing that, I'm going to be putting a few things right in the world.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On the surreality of stepping into the royal family's shoes:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There were a couple moments for us all when it was slightly surreal. Particularly the Queen's funeral. That was very odd to film. And the coronation. You're doing it in a building that has a real ceremonial presence. There's something weirdly ritualistic about it that felt quite off. And then there are the rituals of 'God Save the King.' You feel the resonance of those words that've been shared over centuries and centuries. It's quite powerful when you have throngs of extras all chanting that.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Every character is written in a way that you can follow the through line of their thought... There's no real villain."<span></span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Also doing things that we've chosen to do, the scenes where you're really pushing the boat but you feel you're doing terribly personal things. There's a bit where Kate walks in and demands that Charles sign the bill. She slams down a piece of paper and says, 'Sign it!' That felt quite brilliant to act with this great duty; it was powerful stuff. But I think the brilliant thing is that, with probably the exception of the leader of the opposition, every character is written in a way that you can follow the through line of their thought, of what they're trying to do. And they're totally vindicated; there's no real villain."</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Why she thinks the public is so fascinated with the royal family:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think it's because they're a public display of hundreds of years' worth of history. Unless you're living in the center of London, you're not experiencing that daily amount of history. I think that represents a world that feels quite stepped up from us. They're fascinating to watch because they live completely different lives than the rest of us—certainly not a life I personally could ever imagine. One thing I've found in researching Kate was [that] I couldn't spend an hour in her shoes because of the level of pressure she must experience on a daily basis. I challenge any haters to do what she or William or any of them have to [laughs]."</p><img alt="Suit, Event, Formal wear, Official, White-collar worker, Businessperson, Family, " title="Suit, Event, Formal wear, Official, White-collar worker, Businessperson, Family, " width=2335 height=1557 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kciii-3-1494800816.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Masterpiece on PBS</span></p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On King Charles's decision to defend freedom of the press in the play:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Obviously the play was written several years ago and the issue they're talking about here is privacy, particularly with the press. I know Rupert [Goold, the director] and Mike talked about updating the bill to be about Brexit for the screen, but they changed their minds because they felt it was really important that the issue be directly personal to Charles. I think that's what makes King Charles's choices in the play so much more interesting—that despite having experienced immense pressure from the press, and [their invading] his own privacy, and his family's, and having been hugely invaded around the issue of Diana—he chooses to defend the press. And then, obviously, Diana appearing in the piece. That was such an important part of these people's lives."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">On filming Season 4 of Peaky Blinders:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm really, really excited about being back.
