She was born three years after her older sister, whom she’s been close with since childhood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked if there’s any competition between herself and her Grammy-winning sister, she quickly set the record straight, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Paper</a>, “That’s not even a problem for me.” She added, “We're always looking out for each other.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Navigating the spotlight has its challenges, she told the outlet, but being able to rely on her sister makes it more manageable. “What we tell each other, is let's not pay these haters no attention,” she told Paper. “But it's hard because we really have big hearts.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Together, they’ve worked to tune out the negativity. “It just really hurts our feelings. So we just learned to let people just talk, let them have their opinions, and not take it offensive.

Sometimes everyone would be a little weird about it, but then they would just see like, ‘Oh my God, this is love,’ you know?” She went on, “But now I feel free and now I just try to spread the message as much as I possibly can. Love is love no matter what gender.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hennessy previously dated Michelle “Mel” Diaz, whom she often referred to as her “wife” on social media.

She first went public with their relationship in August 2017, sharing a since-deleted photo of the couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2018, Hennessy came out publicly as bisexual, sharing a sweet and since-deleted snap of herself and Mel kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you can't accept the B In LGBTQ..
