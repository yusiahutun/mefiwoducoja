Mum and nursery nurse, and general lover of life.”</p><p>Roberta Woodhouse from Cumbria was prisoner number JB004 on Jailbreak.</p><p>On the show she was described as "a part-time executive who can smoke a cigarette with her foot".</p><p>Her bio also read: "Other skills include an excellent knowledge of Coronation Street. The Channel 5 psychiatrist described married Roberta as "bubble, bubble, bubble, fun, fun, fun."</p><p>In 2017 she starred in Secret Life of the Ballroom dancer alongside her teenage son Harry.</p><p>The mother and son dancing duo became a hit on the show.</p><p>Interviewed by the Daily Mail on whether Harry, 18, wanted to do the show she said: "Of course he didn’t.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24958332.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_43EDE8FE00000578-4855142-image-m-86_1504632419819jpeg.jpg><p>“I didn’t tell him. What teenage boy wants to wear rhinestones to dance with his mum on national TV?”</p><p>Incredibly, when Harry found out, after being called to audition for the show, he didn’t hate the idea.</p><p>Harry said: “By this point Mum was dead excited. I couldn’t say 'no way', even if I did want to. I didn’t tell my mates though. I work in the computer gaming industry. I’m not sure they’d have appreciated me doing a tango with Mum.”</p><p>The show followed five sets of dancing partners as they joined the world of competitive dancing and attempted to master six classic routines including the samba, jive and quickstep.</p><p>Roberta even used her dancing skills to raise money for Cancer Research UK and held a 12 hour danceathon after her mum was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.</p><p>She wrote: “I need to do something in the name of those I love and for everyone who is affected by cancer... and the only thing I can do is dance!”</p><h3>Hannah Davies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24958198.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Channel-5-Television-Programme-Jailbreak.jpg><p>Hannah Davies, from London, was 24 when she won as prisoner number JB008.</p><p>She was introduced on the show as "a former recruitment consultant, Hannah is creative and practically minded.
