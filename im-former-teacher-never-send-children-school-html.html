We’re all about it — chess teaches so many great virtues and habits that can bleed into every aspect of life: critical thinking, planning ahead, mindfulness, outcome prediction, and more! Also how cute is it that his first answer was transplanting? Here’s how the conversation went: Me: What do you want to achieve before you turn 6? Like, what do you think 6 year old Hudson should be able to do that you can’t do right now? Without missing a beat, he says: “I need to be able to move plants from one spot on the property to wherever I want them, without them dying. Like, I need to figure out how to keep all the roots!” 🥹 This opened up a conversation about transplanting and ALL the things that need to be considered: type of plant, location, sun requirements, water requirements; etc. I explained that this was a really exciting project to choose, because each plant will be different! So, he’s going to study each plant he wants to move, & learn the best way (and place) to move it. 🙌🏼🌱 This boy genuinely loves gardening, and I couldn’t be more proud!
