Yet, for some, using Accutane brings along an unanticipated concern — hair loss. So, does Accutane cause hair loss? No doubt it has been a pressing query for many, especially when they start observing increased hair shedding. The relationship between Accutane and hair health isn't widely discussed, but it's vital to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>The journey to clear skin, especially for those grappling with severe acne, often means exploring different treatments. Accutane has undeniably shown efficacy in battling stubborn acne (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6927052_Isotretinoin_in_treatment_of_acne_Its_efficacy_side_effects_and_recurrence_rate_of_disease","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>). However, every medication has its pros and cons. While Accutane may pave the way for blemish-free skin, its association with temporary to permanent hair loss has raised eyebrows. The good news is that the condition is usually not permanent for those facing thinning of hair or loss due to Accutane. There are also several measures to ensure your scalp and tresses stay in optimal health during the treatment. Let’s take a closer look.</p><h2 id=6579bdee3837c><strong>What Is Accutane?</strong></h2><p>Accutane, known scientifically as isotretinoin, was formerly marketed by the renowned Swiss healthcare giant Roche. Classified as a retinoid, Accutane is essentially a synthesized form of vitamin A (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6927052_Isotretinoin_in_treatment_of_acne_Its_efficacy_side_effects_and_recurrence_rate_of_disease","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>). It's prescribed predominantly to treat hormonal acne as an oral medication in capsule form, dosed typically twice a day, spanning 15 to 20 weeks. Although the intricacies of how Accutane works to counteract acne remain somewhat mysterious, its ability to regulate skin cell accumulation and oil production — major contributors to acne — is well acknowledged (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6927052_Isotretinoin_in_treatment_of_acne_Its_efficacy_side_effects_and_recurrence_rate_of_disease","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=6579bdee3838c><strong>What Does the Research Say About Hair Loss Related to Accutane?</strong></h2><p>Hair loss, marked by a decrease in hair count and density, is a noted side effect of isotretinoin, more commonly recognized by its brand name, Accutane. Research, specifically a certain study, indicated that while this effect was largely temporary, hair thinning may persist even after concluding the treatment (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328467975_Effects_of_isotretinoin_on_the_hair_cycle","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>2</u></a>). It's also worth noting that about 10 percent of those on Accutane experience this temporary hair thinning. Contrasting this, a study in 2018 presented a different perspective, suggesting that isotretinoin doesn't hamper short-term hair growth (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328467975_Effects_of_isotretinoin_on_the_hair_cycle","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>2</u></a>). This study further elaborated that significant disruption in hair growth was observed only when individuals were administered extremely high doses of the drug (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328467975_Effects_of_isotretinoin_on_the_hair_cycle","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>2</u></a>). That’s a lot of contradiction, so let’s try to understand this a bit more.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=6579bdee38393><strong>Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss?</strong></h2><p>Accutane has been linked with hair thinning or loss as one of its side effects. However, a comforting note is that this is typically a transient occurrence. Research data has indicated that a number of isotretinoin users report hair loss, with variables like the dosage taken playing a role in this outcome (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339419714_Alopecia_areata_Due_to_Isotretinoin_Treatment","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","3","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>3</u></a>).</p><p>The natural lifecycle of our hair comprises three phases: growth, transition, and rest (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7329574_The_hair_cycle","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","4","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>4</u></a>). Each phase is intricate, often stretching across several years. Accutane reportedly disrupts the normal hair cycle, halting the growth phase and prematurely pushing the hair into its concluding life phase, resulting in augmented hair shedding (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339419714_Alopecia_areata_Due_to_Isotretinoin_Treatment","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","3","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While some users experience hair thinning and hair loss while on the acne medication, post Accutane hair loss is more a matter of concern.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=6579bdee3839a><strong>How Common Is Accutane Hair Loss?</strong></h2><p>Oral isotretinoin has been a well-established acne treatment. While potential side effects are associated with isotretinoin, hair loss is lesser-known, primarily due to telogen effluvium (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835909/#:~:text=Oral%20isotretinoin%20(13%2Dcis%2D,Administration%20(FDA)%20in%201982.","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","5","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>5</u></a>).</p><p>A retrospective study was conducted on alopecia patients undergoing isotretinoin therapy. During the research phase, these patients were put up against others on isotretinoin with no signs of hair loss at the same timeframe. From the pool of 6330 patients showing hair loss, it was found that 48 had been prescribed isotretinoin between 2013 and 2018. Of this subset, 19 patients reported hair loss during their isotretinoin treatment or within two years (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835909/#:~:text=Oral%20isotretinoin%20(13%2Dcis%2D,Administration%20(FDA)%20in%201982.","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","5","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>5</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The data revealed that compared to the control group, those showing hair loss due to isotretinoin were generally older, had been prescribed higher cumulative doses, and had undergone longer treatment durations (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth","1249937","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835909/#:~:text=Oral%20isotretinoin%20(13%2Dcis%2D,Administration%20(FDA)%20in%201982.","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","5","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>5</u></a>).</p><p>This study indicates that aspects like the dosage or the length of treatment might play a pivotal role.

Dosage Adjustment:</strong> In case hair loss becomes a concern, discussing dosage modifications with a doctor ensures the acne treatment remains effective without the accompanying hair loss.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>So, does Accutane cause hair loss? Well, here we are: Accutane, while powerful in treatment for acne, does come with its set of side effects, hair loss being one of the less common. While this can be unsettling, the silver lining is that for most users, the hair loss is temporary and recovers post-treatment. Understanding the intricacies of this medication helps users get a better hold of its uses. It's always recommended to communicate with healthcare providers to ensure the treatment path you are following is good to go.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth",1249937,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/hair-care/argan-oil-for-hair-1249415","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","Content Also read","beauty","hair-care"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Does Accutane Cause Hair Loss: Understanding the Risks in Depth",1249937,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/hair-care/argan-oil-for-hair-1249415","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/does-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937","Benefits of Argan Oil for Hair: The Magic of Liquid Gold","Also_Read","beauty","hair-care")'><strong>Benefits of Argan Oil for Hair: The Magic of Liquid Gold</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiZnpmlqcZwtMCiqWabkaeycLDOnqpmmZOYwrWtzZ5knJmlqLJutMCiqWakn6jAbn2RbXBya2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-accutane-cause-hair-loss-1249937.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./man-arrested-cutting-brake-line-girlfriends-car-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./man-arrested-cutting-brake-line-girlfriends-car-html.html>Man arrested over cutting brake line on girlfriend's car</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./474225-who-kassandra-rivera-rosie-riveras-daughter.html>Who is Kassandra Rivera?
