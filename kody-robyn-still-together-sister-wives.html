Meri and Kody announced their breakup in a joint <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post in January 2023, a month after People reported that the couple had split. “In light of a recent unapproved press release, we feel compelled to share our own truth, in our own way, and in our own timing,” the statement read. “After more than a decade of working on our relationship in our unique ways, we have made the decision to permanently terminate our marriage relationship. During this process, we are committed to kindness and respect toward each other and to all members of our family, and we are also committed to the continued healing of any and all relationships within the famiy so that we can move forward with forgiveness, grace, and love.” The statement concluded, “In kindness, Meri and Kody.”</p><p>In the caption of her post, Meri slammed People for incorrectly reporting that she had “confirmed” that her marriage to Kody was over before their relationship officially ended. “Today I reclaim my power. Last month’s article by the ‘reputable’ People Magazine quoting me as saying that I had ‘confirmed’ that Kody and I had separated was a complete lie,” Meri wrote. “The information, content, and timing was inaccurate and was based on a highly edited version of events that had been filmed months prior. In the month’s since the taping of those interviews, Kody and I have had many open and honest discussions that have led to our announcement today.”</p><p>She continued, “There is so much more to be told about this story, and I assure you, my truth will be told. But for now, know that there is peace in my heart, and I hold no animosity toward Kody. I am not, and pray that I never will be, in a place where I will enjoy making, or seeing you make, rude and demeaning comments about him. You likely will have a range of emotions and opinions at this news and want to offer comments. In doing so, please be considerate of the fact that we are real people, with real lives, and real emotions. Please try to refrain from congratulating me at the break up of my marriage. I value the relationship I had, and look forward to stepping into 2023 and my future with grace, kindness and power. Step into kindness with me. Put positive energy out into the world. Worthy Up!”</p><p>Meri and Kody share one child: Leon. In December 2022, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> shared a clip of Meri’s interview on Sister Wives: One on One, in which she opened up about her relationship issues with Kody. “‘Sister Wives’ ‘ Meri Brown Confirms Her 32-Year-Marriage to Kody Is Over: ‘He Made the Decision,'” People‘s headline read.</p><p>During the episode, Meri was asked by host Sukanya Krishnan about a scene from Sister Wives, where Kody said that he didn’t consider herself married to her. “If she wanted to move on and marry another, she wouldn’t get an argument with me,” Kody said in the clip.</p><p>When asked for her reaction to the clip, Meri responded, “It just doesn’t make sense to me that he would be so frustrated with Christine [Brown] and be like, ‘She just made this decision. We didn’t consult, we didn’t talk, she just made the decision and then he says, ‘No, I don’t consider myself married to Meri.’ Like, he just made the decision. I’ve never heard him say that to me.”</p><p>In the episode, Meri also explained how moving the family to Flagstaff, Arizona, in 2021, also took a toll on her and Kody’s relationship. “Even since being in Flagstaff, he has led me to believe that he was trying,” she said. “You know, our first anniversary that we had here in Flagstaff, it was cheers to a new beginning as opposed to this last anniversary he’s like, ‘I don’t even know why you called me Meri.’ He’s like, ‘We’re not married. We’re not acting as married.'”</p><p>Meri continued, “I said to him, ‘Then if that’s where we are, don’t you think that we should address that publicly?’ And he said, ‘No I don’t want to address it. I don’t want that to be out there publicly because I don’t want that judgment.'”</p><p>The host then asked Meri: “Where does that leave you? Are you still married to Kody? Or, do you get to decide?” to which Meri hinted that her and Kody’s relationship was over.</p><p>“Well, he’s already made the decision. You just saw him say that,” Meri said. When asked if she’d ever consider reconciliation, Meri told the host that she would be open to it but didn’t think Kody would be. “I would. I definitely would. But I don’t think that he’s interested,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfoLylxYyrppuxnmLAtbXLpWStp5eawamx0Waqoqukmr9uw8ivnKxn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkody-robyn-still-together-sister-wives.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./654c8b9fe2704e75748b45a1-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./654c8b9fe2704e75748b45a1-html.html>Beneficios de la remolacha | Marca</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dermelect-xl-lash-volumizer-serum-7643155.html>A Shopper Said This Dermelect Lash Serum Gave Them Tremendous Growth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dermelect-xl-lash-volumizer-serum-7643155.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
