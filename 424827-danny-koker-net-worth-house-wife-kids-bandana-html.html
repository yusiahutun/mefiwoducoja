She divorced her husband when Drake was five years old</h3><p class=align-left>Dennis Graham and Sandi Graham met at Club Bluenote in Toronto, Canada, performing with his music crew. They soon got married around 1985 and welcomed Drake on 24 October 1986. Five years later, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dennis and Sandi divorced.</a></p><p class=align-left>After the divorce, Sandi and Drake remained in Toronto, while Graham father returned to Memphis. Graham would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer.</p><h3>2. Her ex-husband was incarcerated for several years</h3><p class=align-left>Sandi Graham’s ex-husband, Dennis Graham, was born to a talented family filled with musicians. For example, his uncle was Willie Mitchell, a producer who worked for Al Green, Syl Johnson, Ann Peebles, and Quiet Elegance.</p><p class=align-left>Dennis even taught himself how to play several instruments when he was still a child. But after the divorce, Dennis Graham faced drug-related charges that led to his incarceration.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b4c620763443508a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trinidad Valentin: nationality, Saweetie, family, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His legal issues also limited his finances. As a result, it forced him to remain in the United States until Drake became an adult. Drake referenced his<a href=#> relationship</a> with his father in his 2011 track titled <i>Look What You’ve Done</i>.</p><p class=align-left>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a 2011 interview </a>with <i>Complex, he</i> said that he did not have a father growing up because he was in jail two separate times.</p><h3>3. Sandi Graham struggled while raising Drake</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca8640b3489c08df.jpeg><p class=align-left>After her divorce from Dennis Graham, Sandi remained in Canada to take care of Drake. She tried her best to raise and support her son as a single mother. However, the rapper’s mother faced many struggles, both physically and financially.</p><p class=align-left>They lived on Weston Road in Toronto, which was not the wealthiest area in the <a href=#>world</a>. When his father went to jail, they struggled financially, especially with child support. Sandi also suffered from joint pain and osteoporosis. As a result, she isolated herself in the bedroom for most of her son’s childhood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/70fdda3d03ca6774.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fantasia's husband? Everything to know about Kendall Taylor</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sandi’s poor health also drove her to start smoking. Her joint pain forced her to take pain medications in large amounts. After Drake joined the sixth grade, she moved to Forest Hill, a better town than their previous one, to prevent people from misunderstanding her son because he was a black Jewish. However, she was still broke and<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> rented the basement </a>and the first floor of the house.</p><h3>4. She has featured extensively in Drake’s music</h3><p class=align-left>Since the start of his career, Drake has celebrated his mother in his music. He has shown his unconditional love for her in many of his lyrics and social media posts, making it clear that the two share a bond nobody can take lightly. Some of the <a href=#>songs</a> Drake dedicated to his mother or referenced her include:</p><ul><li><i>Look What You’ve Done</i></li><li><i>The Calm</i></li><li><i>Successful</i></li><li><i>From Time</i></li><li><i>Star67</i></li><li><i>Keep the Family Close</i></li><li><i>Pop Style</i></li><li><i>Child's Play</i></li><li><i>Lose You</i></li><li><i>Can't Have Everything</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d42bfe65ecabd3a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Scoey Mitchell bio: wife, height, movies and TV shows, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While the <a href=#>rapper </a>has referenced his mother in many songs, <i>You & The 6</i> is probably Drake's best song about his mom. It talks about his relationship with his mother, which at times is familiar and relatable. But, in other times, it is bizarre due to his star status.</p><h3>5. She is way shorter than Drake</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><p class=align-left>Sandi Graham stands at 5 feet 5 inches tall or 1.65 metres. The former Canadian teacher also weighs around 55 kilograms. That is incomparable to her son, who is 6 feet tall and weighs about 89 kilograms.</p><p class=align-left>Drake is even taller than his father, Dennis Graham. The former drummer is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs around 70 kilograms. Sandi Graham’s height is one of the primary reasons she is instantly noticeable whenever she graces an event with her <a href=#>celebrity</a> son.</p><h3>6. Sandi Graham has been supportive of her son since childhood</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b325e1e6a0b3397d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Randi Martin: Pat Mahomes relationship, house, job, net worth, kids</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Like all mothers, Sandi Graham has supported her throughout his childhood. Even while she struggled physically and financially, she managed to through her son a Bar Mitzvah, a coming of age ceremony for Jewish boys and girls when they reach 12 or 13. That allowed Drake to decide for himself how he wanted to practice Judaism.</p><p class=align-left>When Drake went to a Jewish school, his peers misunderstood him because he was black. However, his mother uplifted him and made it easier for him to overcome the challenges. Sandi also encouraged Drake to do whatever he wanted to do and what he wanted to be but still <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">count on her support</a>.</p><h3>7. Sandi Graham tried running away from home</h3><p class=align-left>In 2009, Drake released a song titled <i>Successful</i>. One of the lines in the lyrics reads:</p>And my mother tried to run away from home. But I left something in the car, and so I caught her in the driveway.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0672720540634685.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YNW Melly: net worth, height, mom, brother, songs, what happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to the rapper</a>, his mother was going through a rough time. One night, Drake's Jewish mom broke down and tried to run away from the house and leave it all behind. But Drake then saw her bags outside, and she started crying. He hugged her and told her everything would be alright, forcing Sandi to change her mind.</p><p class=align-left>Sandi Graham was born on 28 January 1960 in Toronto, Canada, to Jewish parents. She is the mother of Aubrey Drake Graham, a Canadian-American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, producer, and entrepreneur, and the ex-wife of former drummer Dennis Graham. She worked as a teacher and florist and married Dennis Graham but divorced five years later.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an interesting piece about <a href=#>Kate Silverton</a>.
