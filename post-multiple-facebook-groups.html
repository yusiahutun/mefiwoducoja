Here's how you can get the word out quickly.</p><p>Facebook communities are vibrant, active places&nbsp;full of people looking for a distraction. If you have something relevant and interesting for them to read, they'll be all over it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Just find the perfect way to post, plan your schedule so you're not over-posting, and get to it. Here's what you need to know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-943873_1280-e1443876066807.jpg><h2 id=why-would-you-want-to-post-to-multiple-groups>Why Would You Want to Post to Multiple Groups?</h2><p>Maybe you're looking to sell off some household items to raise some cash and clear some space: there are no doubt several buy/sell/give groups in your local area where you can share photos of your unwanted furniture.</p><p>If you're a blogger, you probably want to promote your latest posts to communities that appreciate your articles. There are thousands of recipe communities who'd love to try your latest culinary invention, parenting communities who long to hear stories about toddlers eating vegetables, and travel communities who love to see where you've been lately.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For writers, there are an incredible number of Facebook groups where members want to know about your free Kindle book. All you have to do is tell them about it.</p><p>There are also plenty of communities who love freebies of any kind, and there are even some groups that encourage business owners to share a link daily. As long as you don't overdo it, these groups actually want you to share.</p><p>These people WANT your information, and getting it to them is not a crime.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=warning-don-t-be-a-spammer>Warning! Don't Be a Spammer!</h2><p>Before you start pasting your links in every single group you know of, remember that Facebook will close down your account if it thinks you're a spammer. Five links per day in groups is the recommended maximum if you don't want to get on the wrong side of Facebook.</p><p>On the human side of things, other people who are in more than one of these groups with you will see your links lumped together in their timelines, making it clear you've just spammed a bunch of groups. You'll look spammy to them and they might report you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>And please, for the sake of everyone's sanity, pay attention to the group rules and the exact topics each group covers. Don't paste irrelevant links and don't promote your wares in groups that don't want to see advertising.</p><h2 id=developing-a-facebook-group-marketing-strategy>Developing a Facebook Group Marketing Strategy</h2><p>What you need is a strategy of some sort. First, you find a tool and a system that works for you, then you make sure you only post as often as is welcome.</p><h2 id=hootsuite><a href=#>Hootsuite</a></h2><p>This isn't quite the solution you're looking for. Facebook's terms of use has prohibited tools like Hootsuite from posting to groups that aren't run by you. So, while you can still schedule a few updates to your own groups, this isn't a tool you can use for the rest of them.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=postcron><a href=#>PostCron</a></h2><p>As for Hootsuite, PostCron is a great scheduling tool, but it also abides by Facebook's rules. If you're an admin of the group you want to post to, you can post on a regular basis using PostCron. For other groups, you're out of luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostCron.png><h2 id=really-simple-copy-paste>Really Simple Copy-Paste</h2><p>Don't forget that you can just open up your list of Facebook groups and open up five groups in new tabs. Then with a specific message copied in your clipboard, you can use a series of keyboard shortcuts to quickly paste that link into the post area, hit enter, close the tab and repeat five times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iMacros.png><p>You could even use some sort of automation like <a href=#>Chromium Browser Automation</a> or <a href=#>iMacros</a> to speed that up even further. If you're going to do this on a regular basis, you could use OneTab or Morning Coffee extensions to keep the links ready to open quickly.</p><h2 id=use-your-email>Use Your Email</h2><p>Facebook groups all have a unique email address assigned to them that corresponds with their Facebook URL. Check the URLs of each group you're in and you'll be able to make a list of email addresses you can send your post to. Don't forget, you can't post to groups you're not in, and some groups will limit posting to admins only.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>For instance:</p><p>OneFantasticGroup@groups.facebook.com</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Facebook-Groups-OnlineCareerist.png><p>Set up a neat email with a short note and your link or images in the message. From here, all you need is some sort of email scheduling software, such as Boomerang for Gmail in order to make sure you don't overdo it.</p><h2 id=slacksocial><a href=#>SlackSocial</a></h2><p>SlackSocial is a slightly different tool, in that you need to create your own Facebook app in order to use it. But don't worry, SlackSocial guide you through the process and make it easy for you to set up. Once that's in place, you should be able to post to multiple groups as yourself easily. The free account should be enough for most users.</p><h2 id=maherpost><a href=#>MaherPost</a></h2><p>MaherPost is a paid solution that requires you to host software on your Windows or Linux Server, plus also set up a Facebook app to run it. There is a live demo you can try on their site if you want to set up a Facebook app to use with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MaherPost-e1443875935532.png><p>Essentially, it lets you set up a schedule and forget about it. Which is perfect if you just want to plug your business or book once a week legitimately.</p><h2 id=how-do-you-post-to-multiple-groups>How Do You Post to Multiple Groups?</h2><p>As you can see, there are lots of options here and many ways to approach scheduling if you've got a lot of groups to post to.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>What's your favorite method?
