Simpson’s daughter? According to both of them, the answer is no. Rumors sparked that Khloé was Simpson’s daughter in November 2011 when her mother, Kris Jenner, revealed her book, <a data-pmc-sp-product=f21d626720f58cf7e7649e3f447259b4 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Kris Jenner... and All Things Kardashian","price":"14.51","id":"1849837503","category":"Actors & Entertainers"},"id":1750645,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian</a> , that she had an affair while she was still married to her late husband and Khloe’s father, Robert Kardashian. (Robert also served as a defense attorney in Simpson’s 1994 murder trial after the deaths of Simpson’s second wife and Kris’ best friend, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.)</p><p>Robert’s wife, Jan Ashley, also alleged in a 2012 interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/khloe-not-kardashian-dad-final-confession-robert-kardashian-star/>Star magazine</a> that Robert told her before his death was Khloe wasn’t his daughter. “Khloé is not his kid — he told me that after we got married,” she said. “He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said, ‘Well, you know that Khloé’s not really a Kardashian, don’t you? And I said … ‘OK,’ and that was it.”</p><p>Kris and Khloe commented on the rumors in Season 7, Episode 1 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2012. In the episode, which was titled “Who’s Your Daddy,” Kris tried to convince Khloe to take a DNA test to disprove the rumors once and for all. “I know all the rumors are absolutely ridiculous,” Kris said. “But I know this is something she needs in order to feel complete.”</p><p>While Kris was able to convince her and Robert’s other kids—Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian—to take DNA tests in comparison, Khloe, for her part, remained firm on her stance not to tke one. “Mom, I don’t care what they’re saying,” Khloe said. “Seriously, my dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is [Caitlyn] Jenner. I don’t need someone to tell me who my family is. I have had the blessing of having two phenomenal fathers. I don’t need a DNA test to prove who my father is.”</p><p>Simpson, for his part, also addressed the rumors he was Khloe’s father in 2022. “People have their types, right? I always thought Kris was a cute girl,” he said on the “Full Send” podcast at the time. “She was really nice. But I was dating supermodels.” He continued, “The rumor ain’t true. It’s not even anywhere close to being true.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/If-I-Did-It-OJ-Simpson.jpg><p>For more on O.J.

Written by Simpson and told in his own words, the book takes readers through Simpson’s famous murder trial after the brutal 1995 murders of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, at her home in Brentwood, California. In the book, Simpson reveals how he would have committed the murders, under the pretense that his confession as “hypothetical.” A new edition of the book was published in 2007 and included essays written by members of the Goldman family, a member of the Goldman family legal team, and Simpson’s ghostwriter, revealing more details about his murder trail and his legal issues after Brown and Goldman’s murder. “One of the most chilling things I have ever read,” journalist Barbara Walters described the memoir.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm5nb2xlZLipuM6eZKSZopmutLTImqVmp5piwKq5z6ymp2WUlsKotNOeqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkhloe-kardashian-oj-simpson-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jelly-roll-wife-bunnie-xo-sex-work-one-year-anniversary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jelly-roll-wife-bunnie-xo-sex-work-one-year-anniversary.html>Jelly Roll's Wife Marks One Year Since She Left Sex Work</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./john-prine-best-lyrics.html>13 John Prine Lyrics That Prove He Wrote Like No One Else</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./john-prine-best-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
