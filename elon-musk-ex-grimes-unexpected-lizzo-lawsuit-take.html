Taking to her former beau's social media site X (formerly known as Twitter), Grimes revealed she wished to send some support Lizzo's way.</p><p id=e1SOs7SpIa0 data-wc=38>"I love Lizzo," her statement began, although she immediately added: "Not saying I don't believe ppl when bad things happen, but I had dancers mistreated on my watch in ways I didn't find out about until way later."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b4f5ccef7f44-grimes-lizzo-unexpected-take-1.jpg><p id=ey51zSMqvuw data-wc=69>The 'Player of Games' singer then continued: "Loyalty matters to me," before explaining her sympathy for the 'About Time' singer some more. "Lizzo was kind to me and others for a decade before she was "cool" and she checked in [on] me when no one cared. I've only ever seen exemplary behavior from her, especially when everyone was hating on me and she was on top of the world."</p><p id=e2iIbILgdl-s data-wc=76>"There was no reason for her to check in, besides to be a good person," the 35-year-old, who is <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a mother of two children</a></strong> who she shares with the Tesla managing director, claimed. "I recall when she first blew up being so happy because I'd never known such an admirable person to find fame in the music industry. I struggle to believe she would have so radically changed," Grimes added, along with a love heart emoji.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lizzo admits to feeling ‘sad’ and ‘rough’ in emotionally charged interview ahead of lawsuit" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d573c959b15f-lizzofacegym-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lizzo admits to feeling ‘sad’ and ‘rough’ in emotionally charged interview ahead of lawsuit" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lizzo admits to feeling ‘sad’ and ‘rough’ in emotionally charged interview ahead of lawsuit</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/adb6e1a36a55-lizzo.jpg><p id=et1delkYD3s4 data-wc=34>She finished her post by writing: "Tired of a culture that seeks to destroy it's [sic] greatest virtues.

Individuals also questioned her claim that Lizzo had nothing to gain from being nice to the singer, but in both cases Grimes responded with further evidence which she wished to reference in Lizzo's defense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e6152290376d-grimes-lizzo-unexpected-take-2.jpg><p id=e8sF6xdz_w2s data-wc=88>"Lizzo was nice to me before elon when she blew up and I was still indie as [expletive]," she said, referring to her career prior to when she began dating the SpaceX billionaire in 2018. "She was nice to me in like 2012 before anyone cared abt either of us," she added, before also saying: "She checked in while I was cancelled… while I was pregnant when most people abandoned me because they didn't want the association, she was kind when [I] was only a liability to her."</p><p id=eT_qVFM9L6JY data-wc=48>Lizzo herself <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>responded to the lawsuit</a></strong> which was brought against her by three of her former backup dancers on August 3.
