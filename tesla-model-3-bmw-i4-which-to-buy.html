The Model 3 has been out for quite a while (since 2017), but it's still a great option if you're shopping for an EV. The BMW i4 is a newer entry in the luxury EV sedan segment, and it's also an excellent, albeit more expensive, option if you're shopping for a sporty, premium EV.</p><p>Let's find out which of these premium electric vehicles is the better buy!</p><h2 id=range-comparison>Range Comparison</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/model-3-charging-unsplash.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tesla Model 3 comes in three different flavors, and each one has a different range estimate. The top-of-the-line Model 3 Performance boasts a 315-mile range. This range puts it among <a href=#>EVs that deliver excellent range</a> numbers, and it's especially impressive when you consider that the Performance upgrade turns the Model 3 into a 450-horsepower monster, so its efficiency is a welcome surprise.</p><p>Lower down in the range is the midrange Long Range AWD model, which has a 333-mile range. The cheapest Model 3 you can buy is the rear-wheel drive base model with 272 miles of range. The BMW i4 can also be had in a variety of configurations with different range estimates. The base model, the rear-wheel drive eDrive35, achieves anywhere from 252 to 276 miles of range, depending on the configuration. This is comparable to the rear-wheel drive Model 3, but the Tesla starts at $40,240, while the cheapest i4 starts at $52,200.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next up in the i4 lineup is the eDrive40 model, which can go between 283 and 301 miles on a full battery. Opt for the i4 xDrive40, and you get between 279 and 307 miles of range. The M50 performance version gets you between 227 and 271 miles of range. The Tesla has better range across the board and a lower entry price as well. The Model 3 is the clear winner between these two when it comes to range.</p><h2 id=which-one-handles-better>Which One Handles Better?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tesla-Model-3-.jpeg><p>Each i4 variant is heavier than the comparable Model 3 version, and the weight difference ranges anywhere from around 700 pounds to almost 1,000 pounds. The i4 M50 is almost 1,000 pounds heavier than the Model 3 Performance, and this difference is noticeable around the corners and during braking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tesla Model 3 is the more exciting car to fling around the corners, especially the lighter rear-wheel drive model, which weighs 3,862 pounds (remarkably light for an EV its size). The BMW, on the other hand, with its rear air suspension, is the better long-distance cruiser (although it does have less range), and it can soak up poor roads better than the Tesla, which is known to have a harsher side (especially the Performance model with the bigger wheels).</p><p>It's difficult to hide the BMW's mass, so if you're looking for a vehicle that's fun around the twisties, the Tesla is the better option. But if you're looking for everyday comfort, the BMW does have a better-sorted chassis for the daily commute.</p><h2 id=acceleration-comparison>Acceleration Comparison</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Model 3 is an absolute beast when it comes to acceleration, and this is true for every model in its lineup. The RWD Model 3 completes the 0 to 60 mph run in 5.8 seconds. This is the slowest Model 3, but it's still as fast as the single-motor i4 eDrive35, which is almost $12,000 more expensive. The more powerful RWD i4, the eDrive40, is slightly faster than the base model eDrive35. It can complete the 0 to 60 mph sprint in 5.4 seconds, but it's also more expensive than the top-of-the-line Model 3 Performance at $57,300.</p><p>The Long Range AWD Model 3 is extremely quick from 0 to 60 mph, completing the launch in only 4.2 seconds, which is substantially faster than the i4 xDrive40 (the lower-powered of the two i4 all-wheel drive models). The Model 3 Performance trounces any i4 model in terms of acceleration, even the $70k i4 M50. It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, which is quick enough to shame vehicles costing more than twice as much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The quickest i4 is the M50, and as previously mentioned, the price tag over $70,000 makes it significantly more expensive than even the Model 3 Performance. The acceleration isn't up to par with the Tesla, though. The i4 M50 goes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, which means the BMW will be left eating the Tesla's dust every time they line up. Tesla wins this category easily with its combination of acceleration and lower price.</p><h2 id=which-one-has-the-better-interior>Which One Has the Better Interior?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/model3vsi4interiors.jpg><p>The Model 3 has one of <a href=#>the coolest EV interiors</a> available. The minimalist design sets it apart from its competitors, especially the German automakers that have a more strict focus on luxury. The Tesla does away with distractions like HVAC vents and a driver-specific display in favor of a cleaner look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might seem like the future of automotive interiors to some, but others might look at the Model 3's interior and come away with the feeling that it's somewhat cheap. This is especially true of the vegan leather upholstery, which many potential buyers feel isn't up to the standards of other automakers' leather interiors (although Tesla should be commended for skipping the real cowhide).</p><p>The BMW i4's interior design is warmer and more welcoming than the more clinical Tesla interior (not to mention its higher quality as well), and drivers even get their own instrument display, which is something the Model 3 lacks. It's pretty nice to check out vital vehicle information without having to glance at the central screen.</p><p>If you want a luxurious experience, the BMW is the one for you. But if you're enamored with Tesla's minimalist interior design, the Model 3 is the way to go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=storage-capacity>Storage Capacity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/model3frunkvs.jpg><p>The Tesla Model 3 destroys the BMW i4 when it comes to cargo capacity. The first thing you should know is that the BMW i4 does not feature a frunk, which is disappointing if it's something you prioritize when shopping for an electric car.</p><p>EVs provide so many benefits when it comes to both passenger space and cargo capacity, but because the i4 is an electrified 4 Series, the packaging isn't as great as what Tesla can offer with its Model 3, which was designed from the ground up as an EV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Model 3 has a frunk that can swallow up to 3.1 cubic feet of your stuff. The rear trunk is also sizable at 19.8 cubic feet. The BMW i4's trunk is lacking in comparison, and it only offers 10 cubic feet of cargo capacity. The Model 3 looks like a hatchback, but it isn't. So in this regard, the BMW does have an advantage when loading items because the hatchback configuration provides better access.</p><p>Overall, the Tesla is the clear winner when it comes to storage space.</p><h2 id=price>Price</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-2023-07-11-at-17-47-37.png><p>The cheapest Tesla Model 3 you can buy (the RWD base model) is $40,240. On the other hand, the cheapest BMW i4 you can buy (the RWD i4 eDrive35) is $52,200. Despite the price difference, the performance of the two is nearly identical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story is the same when you move up to the top dogs in the lineup. The Model 3 Performance rings in at $53,240, while the BMW i4 M50 comes in at an eye-watering $69,700 for the base model. It's difficult to justify paying so much more for the BMW, especially when the Tesla has better range, acceleration, and storage capacity.</p><h2 id=which-one-should-you-buy>Which One Should You Buy?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bmw-i4-driving.jpg><p>Both of these vehicles provide unique benefits, and if you're a diehard fan of either brand, the decision is already made. For those who aren't quite sure yet, the biggest difference might come down to the interiors and the storage capacity of both vehicles. If you like the luxurious ambiance of the i4 (as well as the inclusion of a driver display), you should have the BMW on your radar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the Model 3's super minimalist interior has already won you over and you feel the inclusion of a frunk is vital, then you can't go wrong with the Model 3. The Tesla also offers better range and acceleration at lower prices across the board.</p><h2 id=the-ev-sedan-segment-is-full-of-excellent-choices>The EV Sedan Segment Is Full of Excellent Choices</h2><p>If you're in the market for an EV sedan, you might feel overwhelmed by the number of awesome vehicles to choose from. Both the Model 3 and the BMW i4 are excellent choices for the daily commute, and they're both great for the occasional fun trip to your favorite twisty road.</p><p>There used to be a time when electrified vehicles were boring, but now there are excellent EV choices for all types of driving enthusiasts. Ultimately, whether you choose the Tesla or the BMW, both are excellent vehicles that show you can daily drive an EV that meets all your needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirnquclnquu8Oeo2ZrXZe6uHnIbWSwoJmYtW7AzmaZrrFf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftesla-model-3-bmw-i4-which-to-buy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./martin-von-haselberg.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./martin-von-haselberg.html>Who is Martin Von Haselberg married to?
