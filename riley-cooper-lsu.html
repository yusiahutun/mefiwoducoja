He pitched 12.2 innings, allowing 2 runs on 7 hits and striking out 12.

He was named to the All-Conference team all four years and the All-State team twice in his final three years. Riley also competed in the Area Code Games in 2018 and 2019.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Riley Cooper was born on 17th October 2001 in Arcata, California, but grew up in Fresno, California.

In three playoff outings, he achieved a perfect 1-0 record with a 0.00 earned run average and threw two scoreless frames against Grand Canyon in the Tucson NCAA Regional.</p><p>Riley tossed 2.1 scoreless innings in the decisive Game 3 of the Tucson NCAA Super Regional over Ole Miss, and he tossed an inning without allowing a run in the opening game of the College World Series for the Wildcats’ matchup with Vanderbilt.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Riley had 30 appearances with one start in 2022, leading the team, and finished with a 4-3 record, 4.20 ERA, eight walks, and 35 strikeouts in 40.2 innings. He played in 30 games, ranking fourth in the SEC, and started all three games of the regular season series against Texas A&M, Mississippi State, and Missouri.</p><p>His strong performance in relief at Vanderbilt, when Riley allowed six hits and one run while striking out four and not walking a batter. In the first game of the series against Alabama, he pitched 1.2 innings and earned the victory despite allowing three singles.</p><p>During LSU’s three-game sweep of Missouri, Riley made appearances in all three games, allowing just two hits, no runs, and striking out two batters in 2.2 scoreless innings while earning the win and the save. In two outings during the Arkansas series, he struck out six batters while allowing only two earned runs. He made an appearance in all three games of the Mississippi State series, throwing 40 pitches over three innings with a 1-0 record, 0.00 ERA, and one walk and no strikeouts.</p><p>Riley allowed only one hit over 1.2 scoreless innings while striking out three against Auburn.
