Experiencing a wide range of emotions with great intensity is natural and there is nothing to get worried about. It’s a blessing rather than a curse.</p><p>However, rapid change between high and low emotions can be a diagnostic symptom of mental disorders like bipolar disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) or borderline personality disorder also known as emotional intensity disorder. This is the reason why people who feel intense emotions fear reaching out for therapy even if it’s causing distress to them, as then they could be labelled as mentally ill Or may get diagnosed with some disorder.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The Neurobiology of Music and Emotions</a></strong></p><p>The individuals with intense emotional experience may feel distress and pain due to overload of emotions but once they get self aware of themselves or start getting to know their emotions and core feelings better to be able to cope up with them, they understand that they need not be in control by their emotions.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Signs that shows people feel emotions intensely</h4><ul><li>People make gestures so to express emotions like putting Hands on chest/ heart when they are happy or even sad.

Feeling intensely and profoundly deep emotions affect the ways in which an individual experiences the world. Intellectual over excitability and emotional over excitability are interrelated, that is, If a person has higher intelligence or IQ, they seem to be experiencing their emotions on a much deeper level and may have high Emotional quotient (EQ) too.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>Empathy in Action: Helping Children Navigate Big Emotions</a></strong></p><p>Many people who are gifted of such quality of getting moved by their emotions, don’t seem to look at it that way and may often questions it’s existence and the reason behind them not being in control which makes them think that they are not normal or something is wrong with them. This kind of behaviour or perception could only lead to a stressful mind set and the switch from ‘giftedness’ to ‘a real time problem of feeling too much.’</p><p>Some are naturally gifted with emotional sensitivity while others may develop it if they had undergone through some past traumas, early life experiences, Post traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) or any other mental or even physical illness. Mental health conditions like depression makes the person go through low, sad, helpless emotions on extreme level as compared to a normal human being. Bipolar disorder in which episodes of mania where a person feels extremely high, elevated, excited emotions with lots of energy and depressive episodes which is opposite of mania, can be seen where there is heightened perception of emotions are involved.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>How Emotions Play an Important Role in Decision-Making</a></strong></p><p>Experiencing Intense emotions could be a result of having been diagnosed with Intense emotional disorder or Borderline personality disorder.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Other factors which makes people feel emotions in an intense way</h4><ul><li><strong>Genetics: </strong>The reason behind feeling intense emotions can be due to genetics and biological factors that means a person feels intense emotions because they are born with that ability of feeling too much.</li><li><strong>Emotional overload:</strong> Emotional overload could be a possible reason as sometimes people feels emotions in such extreme manner that they don’t really know how to cope with them or manage them conveniently.</li><li><strong>Lack of coping skills: </strong>Many people don’t know how to tackle such emotions as they’re never taught coping skills or how to experience and manage them the right way. It is also believed that Girls express more emotions than men who were asked to suppress emotions in order to appear strong and rigid no matter what.</li><li><strong>We are human: </strong>One of the most important reason we feel emotions is because we are humans and humans are designated to ‘feel’ their emotions the way they do, be it even intense, as it’s their greatest gift and Feeling emotions or responding to them is what makes human a ‘human’.</li></ul><p>Embrace the gift of feeling emotions too deeply. It’s not something to be fixed or treated with medications, therapy or pressures, but to be happily accepted and appreciated once mastered successfully. It would be a shame to try to suppress or get embarrassed by something that is so beautiful and intrinsic to human being.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Unmasking Shadow: The Silent Battle of a Victim</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>“From being peaceful to into pieces”: The Inner</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Aham Brahmasmi: Deciding Your Self-Image</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 27, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmqaupmLWwuM6gsGaalZ22r7CMoqWtnZ6osm6xzKiroqeeqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpsychology-behind-intense-emotions.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ted-poley-and-rachael-poley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ted-poley-and-rachael-poley.html>Ted Poley and Rachael Poley</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maren-morris-ryan-hurd-divorce.html>Maren Morris Files for Divorce From Husband Ryan Hurd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maren-morris-ryan-hurd-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
