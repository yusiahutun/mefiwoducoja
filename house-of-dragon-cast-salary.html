Given how much the Game of Thrones actors made, it’s understandable why fans want to know about the <a href=# rel=noopener>House of Dragon cast</a> salary and how much the the Targaryen family actor make per episode for HBO’s GOT spinoff.</p><p>House of Dragon is a prequel to HBO’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Game of Thrones</a>, which ran for eight seasons from 2011 to 2019. Both series are based on George R.R. Martin’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> books. House of Dragons—which is specifically inspired by Martin’s 2018 novel, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Fire & Blood</a>—is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen and the events leading up to the the war of succession for the Targaryen crown, also known as the Dance of Dragons.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>RELATED: Click Here For the Best New Binge-Worthy Shows You Haven’t Seen—But Should</a></strong></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a>, creator Ryan J. Condal explained how Martin came to him with the idea for House of Dragon. “George very kindly involved me in this project nearly four years ago. It was September of 2018 when I got called up to the major leagues,” he said. “After that, in the midst, we had this whole pandemic situation that seemed to make time roll back on itself. It just feels bizarre, in a way, after making this thing seemingly inside of a vacuum over in Watford, England, for so long, to suddenly have an audience full of people in a theater [watching] a finished show. There were times that it felt like it would never get finished.”</p><p>So what is the House of Dragon cast salary? Before we discuss how much the House of Dragon cast is worth, let’s recap what the <a href=# rel=noopener>Game of Thrones cast made per episode</a> by the end of the series. According to a 2017 report by <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>, the five main Game of Thrones cast members made $500,000 per episode for the final two seasons—seasons 7 and 8—Game of Thrones, which paid them each around $6.5 million in total. Those five cast members were:&nbsp;Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister). According to The Hollywood Reporter, the Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), and Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell) were a part of the second tier of the Game of Thrones cast and made $150,000 per episode, which would’ve paid Williams and Turner $1.95 million in total for seasons 7 and 8. Dormer’s character died in season 6.</p><p>While the exact House of Dragon cast salary isn’t known, <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported in 2022 that House of Dragon cost around $20 million per episode for its 10 episodes, which amounted to around $200 million in total. In comparison, Game of Thrones cost around $100 million per season. The cost started at around $6 million per episode in season 1 and increased to $15 million per episode for the show’s eighth and final season. Variety also reported that House of Dragon‘s competitor, Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, cost Amazon Prime Video $465 million to produce its eight-episode first season. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Stranger Things season 4 cost Netflix $30 million per episode, which cost a total of $270 million for nine episodes.</p><p>Read on for what we know about the <a href=# rel=noopener>House of Dragon cast salary</a> and how much each of the main cast members is worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/House-of-Dragon-Rhys-Ifans.png><h2>Rhys Ifans (Ser Otto Hightower)</h2><p>Net worth: $12.5 million</p><p>Rhys Ifans plays Ser Otto Hightower, who serves as the Hand of the King to King Viserys I Targaryen.

I knew it was a big deal but was unprepared for the sheer, gobsmacking scale of it. Walking on to the set was like walking into New York but instead of towering skyscrapers, it’s Dragonstone. The crew was nearly 4,000 people, which was jaw-dropping. I’ve caught up since,” she said.</p><p>Due to House of Dragon‘s connection to Game of Thrones, Best also explained that everything, from the scripts to her audition, were kept top-secret. “Everything was very secretive. To audition, we were initially sent a scene from the original Game of Thrones with the names changed,” she said. “We weren’t even told the title of the new show. When eventually I was sent a real script, I loved the writing. Ryan [Condal] and Miguel [Sapochnik, co-showrunners] hooked me in immediately with the driving theme of the series. There is a line my character says early on: “Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend to the Iron Throne.” Lose the word “Iron” from that sentence and it feels all too relevant. To top it all off, they told me my character was a dragon rider. I was in!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/House-of-Dragon-Sonoya-Mizuno.png><h2>Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria</h2><p>Net worth: $3 million</p><p>Sonoya Mizuno plays Mysaria, a foreign-born dancer who is Prince Daemon Targaryen’s most trusted ally.
