She reportedly compiled a list of wealthy Jews in her country and called them “gluttons and thieves.” In addition, Wolf allegedly made derogatory comments about Israel on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>While on leave from her teaching position, she remains a prominent teachers’ union board member. According to the Daily Wire, Wolf, who heads an English department at Takoma Park Middle School in left-leaning Montgomery County, penned a series of anti-Israel online rants. Consequently, her bosses sent her home.</p><p>In December 2022, Wolf posted the names and alleged net worth of five wealthy locals with Jewish last names. She also accused them of being crooks. She wrote that they have not invented or done anything to help their communities on Facebook. “They are gluttons and thieves,” Wolf wrote on Facebook.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>This Progressive Chicago Teachers Union Boss Has Been Tagged a Hypocrite for Owing Bills</a></strong></p><p>“They accumulated this kind of wealth through abusing workers.” According to reports, only four of the listed do-gooders are Jewish. However, Wolf’s attacks continued this year and intensified following the October 7, 2023, sneak attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists. “It is not a war, it is a slaughter,” she wrote on October 28, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Wolf wrote that Israel plans to make Gaza “uninhabitable.” In another post, she included a cartoon of an Israeli tank pointing its cannon at babies at a hospital. She captioned it, “Enemy in sight!” School officials finally had enough and suspended Wolf after penning a letter to parents.</p><p>“I was extremely saddened and disappointed by the contents of these posts,” Takoma Park Middle School Principal Erin Martin wrote. She also condemned Wolf’s views, saying they do not align with the “school’s values of inclusivity, respect and acceptance.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL — Should Public Schools Include Critical Race Theory and Sex Education in Their Curriculum?</strong></a></p><p>Martin added the school is looking into the matter. However, she noted that the school will consider “any actions resulting from the investigation a personnel matter.&nbsp;On the other hand, Wolf defended posting the list of wealthy locals. She said she had “no idea these billionaires are Jewish.”</p><p>In addition, Wolf said she didn’t know her word choice had any historical significance for the Jewish community.” She said, “The diatribe against these two words has turned the discussion into a fallacious attack.”</p><p>Wolf also alleged that people misdirect their anger at teachers and “not the 1% who have not earned their wealth.” “They use their accumulated wealth to further their interests,” she wrote.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Christian Teachers Sue District for Asking Them to Lie to Parents</a></strong></p><p>Consequently, a critic called her out for her response. “Fear is leading to censorship,” she replied. “I hope this person gets anti-imperialism and joins us in the struggle … No war but class war!”</p><p>While the school is still investigating, the issue has sparked public concern. It has ignited debates about the roles of teachers’ unions and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in schools.</p><p>According to reports, Wolf is the second Montgomery teacher placed on leave over antisemitic comments. In November 2023, Tilden Middle School placed one of their teachers, Sabrina Khan-Williams, on administrative leave. The school deemed some of her Facebook posts “antisemitic in nature.”</p><p>Wolf’s antisemitic rants are still under investigation by the school. However, due to employee privacy laws, Park Middle School cannot provide further details.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Biden’s Incessant Desire for Green Energy May Have Some Dark Results</a></p><p><a href=#>This New Law Is Targeting Trains as a Source of Pollution</a></p><p><a href=#>Retired Cop Brothers Save Martin L.
