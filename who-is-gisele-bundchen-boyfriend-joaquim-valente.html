With so many eyes always on her, there is plenty of interest in the Brazil native’s dating life. And Bündchen has had quite a few high-profile romances, from her five-year relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio to her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41518822/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13-year marriage to NFL quarterback Tom Brady" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">13-year marriage to NFL quarterback Tom Brady</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bündchen and Brady met in December 2006 and married in February 2009, then welcomed two children: son Benjamin and daughter Vivian. (Bündchen also became a stepmother to Brady’s son John, from his first marriage, to actor and model Bridget Moynahan.) But the couple <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45205384/gisele-bundchen-reflects-tough-year-tom-brady-divorce-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called it quits in 2022" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">called it quits in 2022</a>, finalizing their divorce that October.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, it appears Bündchen has a new man in her life: jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. While the two have kept their relationship relatively under wraps, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/gisele-buendchen-and-joaquim-valente-are-dating-source-8597786 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> confirmed they were an item in February, and revealed they’ve been dating since June 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, who exactly is Joaquim Valente? Read ahead for everything we know about Bündchen’s new beau.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He runs a jiu-jitsu training academy with his brothers.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Valente is all about moving his body: A native of Brazil like Bündchen, he runs a jiu-jitsu academy in North Miami with his siblings, called Valente Brothers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://valentebrothers.com/our-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the school’s website" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the school’s website</a>, the family first took up the martial art nearly 70 years ago. It all started in 1952, when grandmasters Carlos and Hélio Gracie opened the Academia Gracie in Rio de Janeiro. Soon after, Syllo Valente registered his son Pedro Sr. there. Pedro Sr.’s enthusiasm spurred a generations-long love of the sport, and three waves of Valentes would eventually train under grandmaster Hélio.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the 1990s, Pedro Sr.’s three sons Pedro Jr., Gui, and Joaquim—who had studied the sport since they were small children—were opening their own jiu-jitsu school; they had already taught classes as young adults, after migrating to the United States. In 1998, the Valente Brothers academy officially opened in Miami, and it is now a successful studio modeled after the Academia Gracie.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He met Gisele because she trains at his studio.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bündchen and Valente first met when the model started taking jiu-jitsu lessons at his academy in 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the time, Bündchen was still married to Brady, and a close source told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/gisele-buendchen-and-joaquim-valente-are-dating-source-8597786 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> that she and Valente were strictly platonic at first. “They started out as friends,” the insider said. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The source said the two connected due to shared interests and similar backgrounds. “They come from similar backgrounds,” the insider said. “They both left Brazil very young. They have both created amazing lives for themselves in the U.S. They both love Miami, but also enjoy traveling. They both enjoy healthy living.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along Bündchen, her and Brady’s two kids have also trained in jiu-jitsu at the Valente Brothers academy. In fact, teen son Benjamin was the reason she started studying there in the first place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Initially, I wasn’t even considering it for myself,” she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CktLgFmM_tT/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dust Magazine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dust Magazine</a> in 2022. “But when I brought [my son] to the first class and started talking to Joaquim, I realized that it was much more than self-defense.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He studied criminology at Barry University in Florida.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The youngest of the brothers, Joaquim was followed in Pedro Jr. and Gui’s footsteps when he moved to the U.S. to go to college in 2007. He studied criminology at Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And he stayed close to his brothers, who had both also gotten degrees in Florida years. Eldest brother Pedro Jr. got an MBA from the University of Miami, while Gui also attended Barry, earning a master’s of science in sports management. The two older brothers had already graduated when Joaquim enrolled in college, and were both still teaching jiu-jitsu in Miami at the time. That may have influenced his choice to attend Barry.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He has a private Instagram account.</h2><img alt="screenshot of joaquim valente’s instagram page" title="Joaquim Valente Instagram profile" width=1914 height=922 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2024-02-21-at-3-34-41-pm-65d65e6b0f179.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Joaquim Valente on Instagram</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Valente keeps his personal life out of the spotlight for the most part.

They have to deal with their communities. They have to deal with their family,” she said. “Of course for me, it just happens to be a little bit amplified.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
