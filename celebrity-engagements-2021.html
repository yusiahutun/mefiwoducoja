<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Congratulations are in order for the <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrity engagements of 2021</a>. So far this year, Hollywood has seen engagements from secret couples, reality TV stars and former First Family members. And, if we know anything about stars, there are more celebrity engagements to come in 2021.</p><p>The celebrity engagements of 2021 come after stars such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Ariana Grande</a>, Maria Sharapova, <a href=# rel=noopener>Demi Lovato</a> and Lana Del Rey put a ring on it in 2020. Though not all of the these stars walked down the aisle (Lovato called off her <a href=# rel=noopener>engagement to Max Ehrich</a> two months after he proposed), these engagements still reminded us that there was some good out of the dumpster fire we now know as 2020. “I am so excited to welcome Dalton Gomez into our family! Ariana, I love you and Dalton so much!!!! Here’s to happily ever after! YAY! xoxoxo,” Grande’s mom, Joan Grande, tweeted in December 2020 after the “Thank U Next” singer’s engagement to <a href=# rel=noopener>real estate agent Dalton Gomez</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Aaron-Rodgers-Dating.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-kimmel-aaron-rodgers.png><p>Despite the train wreck of 2020, there was still a lot of love in Hollywood. And from the look of the celebrity engagements of 2021, that same love is continuing this year. From politicians to reality TV stars, take a look at all the <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrity engagements of 2021</a> so far.</p><h2>Kristen Stewart & Dylan Meyer</h2><p>Kristen Stewart and her girlfriend, Dylan Meyer, are engaged after two years of dating. The Twilight star announced her engagement in an interview on SiriusXM’s “Howard Stern Show” on November 2, 2021. “We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said at the time. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”</p><p>The engagement came two years after Stewart told Stern that she couldn’t “f—king wait” to propose to Meyer after just three months of dating at the time.&nbsp;“I want to be, like, sort of somewhat reasonable about it, but I think good things happen fast,” Stewart said. “I have a couple plans that are just the coolest things to do. I’m really impulsive. I don’t know when it’s going to be.” Stewart and Meyer, a screenwriter, met eight years ago, but didn’t start dating until they reunited at a mutual friend’s party in 2019.</p><h2>Chris Harrison & Lauren Zima</h2><p>Former Bachelor host Chris Harrison and Entertainment Tonight reporter Lauren Zima are engaged after three years of dating. Harrison confirmed the news in an Instagram post of him proposing on October 25, 2021. “I love you @laurenzima The next chapter starts now!” he captioned the post. Zima also posted her own photo from the proposal with the caption: “We tell each other this all the time, and we said it again in an unforgettably beautiful moment this weekend: I didn’t know love could be like this. You are the most incredible partner. Thank you for loving me, championing me and asking me to marry you. Here’s to the next amazing chapter, and all the rest 💍”</p><p>The engagement ring was designed by McClave Jewelers. According to Mike Fried, CEO of The Diamond Pro, the ring is&nbsp; three or four carats with a yellow or rose gold band and worth around $100,000. &nbsp;“I estimate the value to be near $100,000 but potentially more depending on the quality of the diamond,” he said. “Her ring exemplifies a timeless look.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Weddingwire</a>, engagement rings on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise range from $45,000 to $100,000. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane, the designer for almost all Bachelor Nation rings. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><h2>Kourtney Kardashian & Travis Barker</h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are engaged. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star announced the news in an Instagram post on October 17, 2021, of her and her now-fiancé on a beach surrounded by candles and roses. “forever @travisbarker,” she captioned the picture.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, Travis proposed to Kourtney at a beachside hotel in Montecito, California. After the engagement news, Kourtney’s sister, Kim Kardashian, posted a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> video of the Poosh founder kissing her soon-to-be husband. “KRAVIS FOREVER 💍 @kourtneykardash @travisbarker,” Kim wrote. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that the proposal was a “complete surprise” to Kourtney.</p><p>“It was a complete surprise for Kourtney. Travis told her family that he planned to propose, but everyone was great at keeping it secret. The Rosewood is their favorite for short weekend getaways. They often stay at the hotel. This is why Travis proposed there. It’s a very special place to them, but it was also easier to keep everything a secret by proposing there,” the insider said.</p><p>The insider continued, “It was a very romantic beach proposal at sunset. Travis took Kourtney for a walk, and you could tell that she wasn’t sure what was going on when she saw all the roses on the beach. Red and white roses were shaped into a heart. There were a lot of candles. They both looked very happy.”</p><p>The source also revealed that Kourtney would “love” to have a “baby” with Travis. The reality TV star shares three kids with Scott Disick: Mason, Penelope and Reign. Travis, for his part, has two kids with Shanna Moakler: Landon and Alabama.&nbsp;“Kourtney is of course ecstatic. She can’t wait to marry Travis. She would also love to have a baby with him,” the insider said.</p><h2>Madison LeCroy & Brett</h2><p>Southern Charm’s <a href=#>Madison LeCroy</a> announced her engagement to her fiancé Brett on Wednesday, October 13. The reality star shared the news in a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>, telling the publication, “Oh, my gosh. I am so excited and I feel like I’ve been trying to hold this in for quite some time and it has been one of the hardest things I’ve had to do.”</p><p>LeCroy dated her now-fiancé for less than a year before he popped the question. The pair confirmed their relationship on Instagram in June 2021. Their romance came just months after LeCroy’s&nbsp;Southern Charm&nbsp;co-star, Craig Conover, claimed that she “flew to Miami to f**k an ex-MLB player.” The South Carolina native later confirmed that the athlete was former New York Yankees player <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>, but she denied ever having a physical relationship with him.</p><p>“He contacted me. And yes, we DMed,” LeCroy said on the Season 7 Southern Charm reunion in February 2021. “But other than that, there was nothing. I’ve never physically seen him, touched him. I am not a f—king liar and I will stand up for that.” Rodriguez, who was engaged at the time to Jennifer Lopez, <a href=#>denied the allegations</a>. Two months later, Lopez and Rodriguez announced their relationship was over.</p><h2>Britney Spears & Sam Asghari</h2><p>Britney Spears and her boyfriend of five years, Sam Asghari, are engaged. Britney announced the news in an Instagram post on September 12, 2021. “I can’t fucking believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!,” she captioned a video of her showing her engagement ring before kissing her fiance. Sam’s talent manager, Brandon Cohen, also confirmed the engagement to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Page Six</a>.</p><p>“The couple made their long-standing relationship official today and are deeply touched by the support, dedication and love expressed to them,” the rep said. “Roman Malayev from NYC is the ring designer. He couldn’t be more happier [sic] to be involved and make this a one-of-a-kind ring.”</p><p>The news came two months after Britney accused her dad and conservator, Jamie Spears, at a <a href=# rel=noopener>court hearing in June 2021</a> of not allowing her to get married or have kids again. “I would like to progressively move forward and I want to have the real deal, I want to be able to get married and have a baby. I was told right now in the conservatorship, I’m not able to get married or have a baby, I have a (IUD) inside of myself right now so I don’t get pregnant,” she said at the time. “I wanted to take the (IUD) out so I could start trying to have another baby. But this so-called team won’t let me go to the doctor to take it out because they don’t want me to have children – any more children. So basically, this conservatorship is doing me waaay more harm than good.”</p><h2>Sophia Bush & Grant Hughes</h2><p>Sophia Bush announced in an Instagram post on August 10 that she and her boyfriend, Grant Hughes, are engaged. “So it turns out that being your favorite person’s favorite person is the actual best feeling on planet Earth 💫 #YES,” she captioned a photo of Hughes on one knee on a boat.</p><p>Before her engagement to Hughes, Bush was married to her One Tree Hill co-star Chad Michael Murray from 2005 to 2006. In an interview on the “Inside of You” podcast in August, Bush explained why she’s done talking about her previous marriage.”I’m not allowed to [talk about him] because I’ve tried to poke fun at being a dumb kid and whenever I’ve done that, it gets twisted into I’m talking shit about somebody who I don’t even know anymore, who’s clearly a grown-up,” she said “I think you have to laugh at who you used to be, but when people ask me about history that involves someone else…it’s not worth my time. It’s not a place where I harbor ill will or anything.” She continued, “I was a very naïve 21-year-old kid, and that’s all there is to it.”</p><h2>Clare Crawley & Dale Moss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Clare-Dale-Bachelorette-2020.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> reported in July 2021 that season 16 Bachelorette Clare Crawley and her winner, Dale Moss, are engaged again six months after their breakup over cheating rumors. “They’re engaged but still are working on building a solid relationship. They’ve discussed future plans but aren’t necessarily wedding planning,” a source said. “They aren’t rushing to tie the knot.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>couple got engaged</a> in 2020 on The Bachelorette. Two months after their engagement aired, Dale announced in an “mutual statement on his Instagram that he and Clare had broken up.<a href=# rel=noopener> Clare slammed him</a> on Instagram at the time, claiming that she wasn’t aware of Dale’s “mutual statement.” A couple weeks later, E! News reported that <a href=# rel=noopener>Dale had cheated on Clare</a> with Eleonora Srugo, a real estate agent in New York City that he knew before her season. (Srugo denied that their relationship was romantic.) According to Us Weekly’s source, Clare and Dale are engaged again but still “working on some issues.”</p><p>“They’re still working on some issues they have to overcome but it’s not like they make it known,” the insider said. “They’re more private when it comes to their issues. The good thing is that they’re happy together and enjoying this time as an engaged couple. They love each other very much and care for each other.”</p><p>The source continued, “[They are] a much better place than where they were months ago….They have plans to travel this summer. She still has her home in Sacramento. Sacramento will always be home to her and she’ll be in California a lot still since she still takes care of her mom and her sisters live there.”</p><h2>Bella Thorne & Benjamin Mascolo</h2><p>Mascolo, a singer and Thorne’s boyfriend of two years, confirmed their engagement in March 2021 with a series of Instagram photos of the Shake It Up alum showing off her engagement ring. “She said YES 💍🖤 @bellathorne,” he captioned the post, which included snaps of the engaged couple kissing.</p><p>Mascolo later posted a video on his Instagram Story of him and Thorne at their engagement party. “Thank you for being amazing, baby. I love you so much,” he said to his soon-to-be wife. Thorne responded, “I love you so much. Let me give you a kiss. Mascolo then asked, “When are we getting married? Soon I hope.” He went on to reveal that the couple wanted weddings in both Italy, where he’s from, and the United States.</p><p>According to Tonia Zehrer, Signet’s senior vice president and chief merchandising officer, the cost of Thorne’s ring is well in the six figures. “This ring appears to be a stunning pear-shaped center stone framed with a halo of diamonds with a white gold band that is accented with diamonds as well,” Zehrer told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a>. “Depending on the quality of the stones, we believe this ring could retail above $65,000.”</p><h2>Paris Hilton & Carter Reum</h2><p>Hilton announced in an Instagram post in February 2021 that she’s engaged to entrepreneur Carter Reum after a year of dating. “When you find your soulmate, you don’t just know it. You feel it. 💫 My love & I have been together since our first date, and for my birthday, he arranged a special trip to tropical paradise. 🏝️,” she captioned a video of Reum propoising. “As we walked to dinner along the beach, Carter led us to a cabana adorned with flowers and dropped to one knee. 💍 I said yes, yes to forever ❤️ There’s no one I’d rather spend forever with. ✨ To see more photos of my birthday dream come true, visit ParisHilton.com.

As someone who traveled constantly, I had a chance to stay home and reevaluate what was important to me. My relationship and the time I spent with Carter was a gift,” she said. “I’m excited for our next chapter.”</p><p>Reum, for his part, also gushed over his soon-to-be wife.&nbsp;“I have gotten the unique opportunity to get to know the real Paris on a daily basis just the two of us during these past 15 months and I couldn’t be more excited and lucky to have her as my future wife and partner,” he said. “She shines with her kindness, work ethic, authenticity and her voice in making the world a better place and she will do the same as a future mother and wife.”</p><p>Hilton’s ring was designed by Jean Dousset, the great-grandson of Louis Cartier. Reum proposed to her while they were celebrating Hilton’s 30th birthday on a private island. After their engagement, the two had an intimate celebration with Hilton’s sister, Nicky Hilton, and Reum’s brother, Courtney Reum.</p><p>Reum, a longtime friend of the Hilton family, started the venture capital firm M13 Investments in 2013.
