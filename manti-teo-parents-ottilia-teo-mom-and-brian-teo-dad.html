They are back once again on Netflix’s new special Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist.</p><p>Learn more about Manti’s parents here in this article. We cover their age, job, family, and current residence.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Manti Te’o Parents?</strong></h3><p>Brian Te’o and Ottolia Te’o are the parents of Manti Te’o. Manti, the oldest of their children, is the subject of the Netflix show Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist was in a serious relationship with his girlfriend Lennay Kekua who he met online. But the catch was he had never met her but he still believed that he should share about his dating life with his parents.</p><p>Manti maintained that he felt a religious connection with her from their online conversations. “It was the spiritual aspect that took over,” said Matni. “The spiritual aspect — where in my past relationships, spirituality wasn’t a big thing. It was something, but it wasn’t at the forefront. She would always tell me that, ‘Manti, the only man I love more than you is — well, two men, is God and my dad: I’ll never put you in front of God.’</p><p>Manti added, “She would say stuff like that, and, we’d say prayers at night before we’d go to sleep. Then when we’d wake up in the morning, obviously, because I was on the phone, she’d say another prayer. She would always tell me to be humble. For me, that’s what drew me in.”</p><p>Brian and Ottolia also claimed that they spoke with the woman. They were under the impression that two had met each other.</p><p>On the show, Manti’s parents described Manti as a “loving husband and father” and “an incredible son”. In the show, Brian opened up about his son’s relationship, “They started out as just friends. Every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, and that happened to be the time Manti was home, so he would meet with her there. But within the last year, they became a couple. And we came to the realization that she could be our daughter-in-law”.</p><p>Manti had lied to his parents because he was scared that they wouldn’t approve of a person he had never met. His mother also defended her son saying, “That’s my child. He always puts others before himself. He did what a responsible respectable man should do … I am proud of his character. It just hurts to see his picture and his name being displayed as someone dishonest.”</p><p>Brian also defended his son saying, “If they’re saying Manti lied about something, they might as well say we lied about it today … The story was reality for us.”</p><p>The Netflix documentary puts things into perspective by demonstrating how they disregarded the warning signs and ultimately dealt with the situation. You may be wondering what Brian and Ottolia are doing now that the problem has been cleared up.</p><h3><strong>Meet Manti Te’o Dad, Brian Te’o</strong></h3><p>Brian Te’o is the father of Manti Te’o.</p><p>Brian was born to his parents Normalynn Te’o and Ima Uiva Te’o in Samoa.
