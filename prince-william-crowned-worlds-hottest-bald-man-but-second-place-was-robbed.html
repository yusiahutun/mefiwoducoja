But the heir to the throne’s head has been thrust into the limelight once again, according to a new list.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Prince William</a> has been crowned as the sexiest bald man of 2023 – trumping some of the world’s biggest stars. The <a href=#>royal</a> was given the new title after a survey found that 88% percent of women find bald men attractive, and Prince William has made it to the top of the charts. He managed to beat A-list <a href=#>celebrities</a> on the list as well as decorated actors and even a billionaire.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-named-as-world-s-sexiest-bald-man>Prince William named as ‘world’s sexiest bald man’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1240617562-1024x694.jpg><p>The man who is first in line to the throne is most likely occupied with another crown instead of this list. Nonetheless, he has been give the No 1 spot for 2023. It comes after he was dethroned last year by none other than Vin Diesel, the Fast and Furious <a href=#>movie</a> star.</p><p>But it seems he’s clawed his way back to the podium for the gold medal for 2023.</p><p>Data from SEO agency, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Reboot</a>, examined a number of factors to determine the Top 10 men who meet the quota.</p><p>They looked at golden ratio facial proximity, voice attractiveness, global search interest and cranial shine factor to determine the results. Now, they’ve produced a whole new ranking of the world’s sexiest bald men – and Prince William is the winner.</p><p>He was given a generous score of 9.88, with a vocal attractiveness of 9.91, and a shine factor of 8.90. Whereas, his net worth is actually the third lowest on the list, standing in at $100 million.</p><p>We’re not sure if the heir is going to run off to tell wife <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> of the news. But she probably understands the allure, as they’re happily married with three children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-celebrities-who-missed-out>The celebrities who missed out</h2><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars who missed the top spot include the likes of Vin Diesel (number two), Jason Statham (number three) and even Jeff Bezos (number five).</p><p>Vin Diesel may have been crowned the winner in 2022, but he only scored an overall result of 8.81 this year. We’re not sure what changed exactly.</p><p>Jason, on the other hand, came in at third place despite having a lower voice attractiveness result than <a href=#>Samuel L Jackson</a> and Michael Jordan. Jeff Bezos may be one of the richest people on the planet, but money didn’t buy him the medal in this case. We’re sure his fiancé doesn’t mind, though.</p><p>The full list as follows:</p><li>Prince William</li><li>Vin Diesel</li><li>Jason Statham</li><li>Samuel L Jackson</li><li>Jeff Bezos</li><li>Michael Jordan</li><li>Dwayne Johnson</li><li>Shemar Moore</li><li>Shaquille O’Neal</li><li>Terry Crews</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/Sexiest-bald-men-2023-v1-1-575x1024.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-took-a-swipe-at-william-s-bald-spot-in-his-book>Prince Harry took a swipe at William’s bald spot in his book</h2><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s book unveiled several revelations, and he even mentioned his brother’s receding hairline in his memoir.</p><p>The duke wrote: “I looked at Willy, really looked at him, perhaps for the first time since we were little, taking in every detail: his familiar scowl, which had always been the norm in his dealings with me.”</p><p>The 38-year-old added William’s baldness was “alarming” and more “advanced than mine.” He also thought William’s resemblance to their mother, Princess Diana, had “faded” with age.</p><p>Later on in, he also called him his ‘arch nemesis’ referring to how much the siblings have drifted apart.</p><p>But the royal, who lives in his <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> with his family, saw the spotlight shine on him earlier this year. A photo of the dad-of-two on the BetterUp company website, where he is Chief Impact Officer, caused a stir on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. The image appeared to show his hair thicker and darker, a striking contrast to recent photos of him at the time.</p><p>One royal expert even believed that his <a href=#>tension with his brother Wills</a> could be the problem of his thinning locks.</p><p>Spencer Stevenson, from Spex Hair, explained: “Harry’s hair loss is categorically male pattern baldness, so already thinning out due to his genes.</p><p>“However, due to the high amount of stress he must’ve been through in recent years dealing with all the exposure surrounding him and his life, it will have definitely negatively impacted his hair.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aBcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZpuipMSvscNmrqiqnJnAbrTOraueq6Rir6K4w2akmqZdl8K1edKemqimlGK9ra3CnmSwmaNiv7CuwZ6baA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-william-crowned-worlds-hottest-bald-man-but-second-place-was-robbed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./475573-tharita-cesaronis-bio-dermot-mulroney-relationship-background-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./475573-tharita-cesaronis-bio-dermot-mulroney-relationship-background-family.html>Tharita Cesaroni's bio: Dermot Mulroney relationship, background, and family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pasta-with-longer-cooked-broccoli.html>pasta with longer-cookedbroccoli</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pasta-with-longer-cooked-broccoli.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
