When you come across an event you tend to react with a reflex which is also known as an immediate reaction to an unpredicted stimulus. For example, if you see a ball suddenly thrown in your direction, either you duck or catch the ball. That is your reflex, that is an immediate bodily response to an unwanted stimuli.</p><p><span><span>‘Every action has an equal and opposite reaction’ is a quote which you are all aware of, and for a matter of fact everyone would agree on this statement due to the various experiences one has come across. </span><span>Associating actions and reactions to the current situation of Covid-19, where the pandemic has created a chaos all over the world. </span><span>The outburst of the pandemic started to spread panic among the human race. </span><span>Initially people were blank, did not know how to react, did not know what to think, what to do in such a situation, started getting scared, fearful to step out of the house etc. </span><span>This one stimulus gave rise to numerous reactions in the human beings. </span><span>This tells that it is not necessary that a single stimulus will have a single response, it can have multiple response with multiple intensities of the expressions. </span><span>People started getting affected tremendously where the symptoms and the cure was unknown. </span><span>Gradually the experts, doctors have worked upon understanding the problem, its symptoms, causes, the effects it might have and how it can be treated to decrease the symptoms. </span><span>Countries with high population have been affected very badly where there have been large numbers of loss of lives.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Covid-19 is an unwanted and unpredicted situation, for which nobody was prepared or ready to face anything like this. </span><span>Guidelines provided by doctors, hospital protocols were followed immediately by the people of the society in order to avoid any kind of exposure to the virus. </span><span>The fear in people made them realize the urgency of taking precautions to avoid the problem. </span><span>People started caring about their immunity level, health check to keep themselves safe. </span><span>These were the immediate steps taken by the people, but what else happened which made a negative impact on the emotional, social and psychological aspects of human beings? </span></span><span><span>The people were made aware of the different symptoms one might have if they were carriers of the virus. </span><span>People started avoiding others who had just traveled back from abroad, they started behaving like strangers with people who are their own neighbors, people gave away negative vibes through non-verbal cues which affected the mental health condition of others at the receiving end. </span><span>Why such a reaction? </span><span>Why is there so much of negativity instead of empathy and support? </span><span>It is understandable that one is fearful of the situation but creating panic for someone else and behaving badly in such situations with others is incorrect. </span><span>It is the time where everyone needs each other’s support to get through the hard time together. </span><span>The pandemic is already unwanted and on top of that unwanted negative reactions from your own friends and family is going to make things worse. </span><span>It is important to think and understand the extremity of the problem which everyone is going through and everyone needs to be safe and sound from it. </span><span>Rather than avoiding people because they have cough and cold, trying to ask the cause and their health condition is essential. </span><span>This can be done by keeping social distance in order to take precautions. </span><span>Being empathetic, supportive, helpful is going to help everybody to think rationally and take appropriate decisions. </span><span>trying to ask the cause and their health condition is essential. </span><span>This can be done by keeping social distance in order to take precautions. </span><span>Being empathetic, supportive, helpful is going to help everybody to think rationally and take appropriate decisions. </span><span>trying to ask the cause and their health condition is essential. </span><span>This can be done by keeping social distance in order to take precautions. </span><span>Being empathetic, supportive, helpful is going to help everybody to think rationally and take appropriate decisions.</span></span></p><p><span><span>It is a situation from which no one can run away. </span><span>It is a situation where one has to face the challenges head on without any hesitations, because hesitation can do harm to oneself. </span><span>When there is a friend who needs guidance with studies, you tend to guide them with all kind of help and support. </span><span>When it comes to a pandemic, why one needs to change? </span><span>Why can’t everyone process the situation and the different perspectives of the situation to grow better each day? </span><span>Thinking about self-first is important in these tough conditions but thinking about people in our lives and being available for them when they need is also to be taken into consideration. </span></span><span><span>Think about it. </span><span>What if you are diagnosed with the virus? </span><span>Wouldn’t you contact your family and friends immediately for help? </span><span>What if they tell you that they can’t help you, or do anything for you? </span><span>How would that make you feel? </span><span>Shattered? </span><span>Helpless? </span><span>Sad? </span><span>Yes, because that is the way in which your mind and emotions will react as it is not expected. </span><span>You live each day creating and spreading positivity everywhere and that is what matters the most.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“If you have knowledge, let others light their candles at it.”</span></span><br><span><span>–&nbsp; </span></span><strong><span><span>Margaret Fuller.</span></span></strong></p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Rising Back after SetBacks in Life</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Empowering Minds: Revolutionizing Teenage Mental Health in India</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding correlation between attachment styles and life satisfaction:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Social</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychological First Aid (PFA): An Immediate Assistance to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Education</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Navigating Life’s Transitions: Academics and Beyond</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmnq6Vp8ZurcKtoKimXZ2utHnAp2SeqaWWuW6tzZ1kqKigpMCqwMRmqZ6Zk6m2sLqO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html>From zero to 303.313km in under a year: how Hong Kong entrepreneur Vriko Kwok went Further than she</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./celebrity-engagements-2021.html>Celebrities Getting Married in 2021</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./celebrity-engagements-2021.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
