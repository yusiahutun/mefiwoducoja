I may have never told you, but you are the most handsome man I have ever met. You have filled my life with so much love and heart with eternal happiness. You are the source of my joy, the centre of my world and the whole of my heart. Every day and night, my mind is filled with thoughts of you.

And knowing that you are mine, I feel the happiest woman on the planet. I cannot imagine living my life without you. As long as the sun continues to shine, you can be sure that my heart will remain yours. You are the most amazing boyfriend, and I am the luckiest girlfriend. With love from the one who adores you.Sweetheart, I may have made wrong choices in my life, but I am happy that I chose you when it comes to love.

I'm the luckiest woman in the world because I can truly say that I'm in love with my best friend. My only wishes in this world are to spend as much time as possible with you and enjoy every second of it; to keep writing our beautiful love story, and never stop writing it. I can't stop imagining what a future with you will look like. In a beautiful house with flowers and our kids playing all around the house. Thank you for loving me, pampering me, and caring for me. With you, I am complete. Darling, I can remember the day we met like it was yesterday. You are the sun in my sky, the river that runs through my soul, and the very air I breathe. You have given me a new meaning in life. Without you, I am worthless. My life revolves around you. There is no single second that passes without thinking about you. You are my soulmate and everything I ever wanted, so there's no need to doubt my true feelings for you. I treasure you so much as you are the sweetest, caring, and kindest boyfriend that a girl could ever want. I don't want to spend my day far away from you anymore.
