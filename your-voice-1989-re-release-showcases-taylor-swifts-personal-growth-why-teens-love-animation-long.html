Fans couldn’t wait to stream it when it was released on October 27, and it broke numerous records on Spotify; it is already on course to become 2023’s album with the most streams in a single week. The name of the album refers to Swift’s year of birth, 1989.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</span><span type=text> is all about the experiences that shaped her into the person she is today. Her lyrics convey emotions that can be difficult to describe. For example, “Blank Space” reflects how she felt about the way she was depicted in the media, and writing the song helped her overcome her insecurities. The catchy tune and relatable lyrics made the song popular among netizens when it was first released in 2014. It surpassed a staggering 2.2 billion streams on Spotify and more than three billion views on YouTube and won many awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video and the American Music Award for Song of the Year.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=c2b2cb85-2556-42b0-984e-95441fdf4f43 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>6 literary references in Taylor Swift’s</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>Folklore</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>and</span></strong><span type=text> </span><strong type=strong><span type=text>Evermore</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Another award-winning and record-breaking lead single, “Shake It Off”, is a joyous tune and teaches people how to cope with problems in a lighthearted way. This crowd-pleasing single increased Taylor Swift’s popularity, ultimately contributing to her success.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Now that we have discussed some popular hits, let’s dive into some underrated songs and vault tracks. “This Love” is one of the singer-songwriter’s most undervalued songs despite its rich lyrics detailing intense heartbreak. The song talks about a love that has ended and how difficult it can be to come to terms with the reality and sorrow of losing a loved one. There is a lot of symbolism in the lyrics, with clear blue water symbolising tranquillity, peace and contentment, and currents and tides representing conflicts and endeavours faced in the relationship.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Though this emotionally stirring song did not gain as much attention as her lead singles when it was originally released, it reached around 150 million streams in a week. Another undervalued song is “Out of the Woods”, which describes another failed relationship and the anxieties she has experienced. Unfortunately, many Swifties regard this song as monotonous and fail to understand the implication behind the lyrics and tune, which convey the apprehension Swift experienced in her relationship.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Swift has built up a massive fanbase thanks in part to her relatable lyrics.

The song gives listeners a glimpse into Swift’s toxic relationship with Styles and how angry it made her. She mentions that she intended to “jump off very tall somethings” but that her partner deterred her from doing so in the end. Some speculated that she could not release the song earlier due to the potential backlash she might have suffered.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</span><span type=text> talks about difficult events that occurred behind the scenes and troublesome moments that have defined Swift’s identity today, and it signifies her personal growth throughout her successful career.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=98ac02c6-3471-4185-a498-184312c2e26c data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Taylor Swift and Coldplay are skipping Hong Kong on their Asia tours - but why?</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>How animation can benefit teens</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Alvin Wong Yu-man from Carmel Secondary School</span></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In recent years, there has been a noticeable surge in the popularity of animation among teenagers.
