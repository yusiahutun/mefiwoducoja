Rather than let this be another divisive talking point in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/millennials-gen-z-differences-tweets_l_6095d569e4b0aead1b83d142 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="millennials vs. Gen Z culture wars" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>millennials vs. Gen Z culture wars</u></a>, let’s have an honest conversation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fatphobia wasn’t invented in 2001, but one could easily argue that a rise in Internet access played a pivotal role in Y2K’s hyper-toxic culture.

But even if social media hadn’t started to take off in the early aughts, traditional media channels made it clear: Thin was in.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>It's like the clothing was built in a way that made your body look distorted.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion industry played an integral role. For <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/angelamariebenedict/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="YouTuber Angela Benedict" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>YouTuber Angela Benedict</u></a>, who was an aspiring actress in her early 20s, the clothes were shrinking, “I hadn’t gained any weight. Why am I looking this way? Why is my stomach spilling over? Why are my hips protruding? It's like the clothing was built in a way that made your body look distorted.” Benedict recently shared her experience with disordered eating in a video titled "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youtu.be/YlnjBMAi6jM data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Y2K Gave Me an Eating Disorder" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Y2K Gave Me an Eating Disorder</u></a>."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Reflecting on these unforgiving fashion trends makes one wonder about the idolatry of youth in fashion. The average age for models entering the industry in 2011 was between <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.statista.com/statistics/220912/average-age-for-models-to-start-in-the-business/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13 and 16 years old" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>13 and 16 years old</u></a>. The models were pubescent, but the clothing they were modeling was being marketed and sold to adult women, who in turn internalized the message being sent. “You either thrifted, made your clothing, or there was the option a lot of us took—change yourself to fit the clothes,” Benedict says. It took her years to come to terms with her body dysmorphia. It wasn’t until last year, when she turned 40, that Benedict even realized she had an eating disorder.</p><img alt="387028 38 actress gillian anderson arrives at the vanity fair post oscar party march 25, 2001 at mortons restaurant in west hollywood photo by jason kirkgetty images" title="Vanity Fair Post Oscar Party" width=1583 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-816214-1626793082.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jason Kirk</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Y2k fashion trends—with their emphasis on low-rise jeans; exposed thongs; and baby tees—were understood to celebrate a very specific body type, one generally found in teenaged girls. The trends helped normalize the sexualization of pubescent girls. Young women internalized this message, unknowingly embarking on a lifelong pursuit of youth and thinness, never stopping to critically assess the unrealistic body standards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The media furthered that message by consistently pushing thin, white fashionistas as the standard of beauty.

Ferrera, who is Honduran, looked like so many Black and Latinx girls in my life. Ditto for America's Next Top Model alum Toccara Jones, who was singled out as a plus-sized model. Even Beyoncé (who coined the term bootylicious in 2002) couldn’t escape it; a 2009 NBC.com story headline reads, “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcwashington.com/local/beyones-rep-she-is-not-fat/1869689/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Beyoncé's Rep: She Is Not Fat" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Beyoncé's Rep: She Is Not Fat</u></a>,” and she wasn’t.</p><img alt="the sisterhood of the traveling pants, america ferrera, amber tamblyn, alexis bledel, blake lively, 2005, c warner brotherscourtesy everett collection" title="THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS, America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively," width=2100 height=1390 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-part-1-everett-1626793437.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s a lot to be said about the lack of discourse around our Y2K experiences with body image. This is an extension of the idea that women of color don’t have these issues. Some academic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-425 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=studies class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>studies</u></a> prevalent at the time stated that Black girls and women were more satisfied with their bodies than their white counterparts. The predominantly white media took that to mean that these issues didn’t exist for us. But they did, and early-2000s Black media was just as problematic. Look at Moesha; after the iconic show was picked up by Netflix last year, viewers were shocked by blatant fatphobia, mostly thrown at Moesha’s friend Kim Parker, played by actress Countess Vaughn.</p><img alt="the parkers" title="The Parkers" width=982 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/promotional-photos-from-the-upn-sitcom-the-parkers-pictured-news-photo-1626797570.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">CBS Photo Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No discussion about Black women’s body image issues in the early 2000s would be complete without discussing the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_vixen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="video vixen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>video vixen</u></a> (as New Yorker writer Doreen St. Félix <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/dstfelix/status/1396847289029824514?s=11" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pointed out" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>pointed out</u></a>). “Urban” media, including magazines like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://king-mag.com/see-every-king-magazine-cover/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=King class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>King</u></a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.xxlmag.com/category/eye-candy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=XXL class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>XXL</u></a>, as well as music videos and movies geared toward Black audiences, peddled a specific look.

Popular brands like Baby Phat, Sean John, Rocawear, and the aptly named Apple Bottoms used the same advertising models. Popular music videos of the artists behind these brands Sean “P.

We’re in a much different place than we were in the early 2000s; to McCall, that’s a good thing. “I think because [Gen Z has] grown up in this environment of body positivity, it’s different,” she shares. “I think growing up in a media that says you can have plus-size models on runways or fat influencers that it doesn't feel the same to them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The optimist in me would like to agree.
