<time>23 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Throughout Shannon Sharpe’s career, he has been involved in a lot of controversies when it comes to his relationships. He has been rumored to be married to a hand full of ladies and has been involved with several women, mostly fitness inclined.</p><p>While we know Shannon Sharpe as a ladies’ man, fans are still eager to know if he is married. If he is, then who is Shannon Sharpe’s Wife?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shannon_Sharpes_Wife_Who_Is_She></span>Shannon Sharpe’s Wife: Who Is She?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shannon was rumored to be married to <a href=#>Katy Kellner </a>around 2016. Katy, an American fitness instructor and educator, was born in the early ’80s, although the exact date of her birth has not been publicly disclosed.</p><p>She grew up in the United States with her siblings, raised by her father, a high school football coach, and her mother, a homemaker. Katy became interested in sports at a young age and participated in soccer, track, and volleyball during her school years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-7_23_44_31.jpg><p>After graduating from Elmhurst College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2003, Katy pursued further education at Troy University, where she obtained a Master’s degree in instructional technology.</p><p>Following her studies, she worked as a teacher at Fulton County Public School for three years before transitioning into a career as a fitness instructor. Katy was dedicated to her fitness routine, working in the gym four to five times weekly. She also studied diligently to pass the necessary tests and obtain certification as a fitness instructor.</p><p>Later, Katy partnered with Marlon Byrd, a well-known baseball player, to establish the Thousand Oaks Gym in California. Katy is employed as an instructor at Flywheel Sports and is a senior master instructor at a cycle bar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Katy_Ever_Shannon_Sharpes_Wife></span>Was Katy Ever Shannon Sharpe’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to rumors, Shannon Sharpe never got married to Katy. Shannon never got married. Shannon and Katy met in 2013 at Thousand Oaks Gym in California. Shortly after, they began going on dates. The two were spotted together several times around Los Angeles before getting engaged in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Shannon and Katy reportedly separated in 2018 when Shannon discovered that Katy was pregnant with Marlon Byrd, her business associate’s child. The two were no longer seen around each other in public, and in December of that same year, Katy gave birth to Marlon’s son. She was later rumored to have married Marlon. On the other hand, Shannon has been involved with other ladies besides Katy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-7_23_48_14.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Erika_Evans_Relationship_With_Shannon_Sharpe></span>Erika Evans’ Relationship With Shannon Sharpe<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shannon Sharpe became a father for the first time in 1992 when his son Kiari was born. During his NFL career, Shannon never publicly discussed the identity of Kiari’s mother. However, it was later revealed that Erika Evans is the mother of Kiari after she filed a lawsuit accusing Shannon of forcing her to leave his home.</p><p>In 2004, Shannon and Erika Evans were involved in an altercation at his house, which led to law enforcement being called. Although no arrests were made then, Shannon turned himself in to the police after Evans filed battery charges against him.</p><p>Kiari was around 12 years old when the incident happened. He has since grown up but did not pursue a career in football like his father. Instead, he attended Georgia Southern University, where he double majored in psychology and business management, graduating in 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shannon_Sharpe_and_Michelle_Bundy></span>Shannon Sharpe and Michelle Bundy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2010, Shannon Sharpe was embroiled in a controversial situation involving a woman named Michelle Bundy. Michelle claimed to be Shannon’s girlfriend and made various allegations against him, including accusations of sexual assault.</p><p>As a result, a criminal investigation was conducted to examine the validity of her claims. Ultimately, it was determined by the court that Michelle Bundy had fabricated the story she presented.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Did_Shannon_Sharpe_and_Nicole_Murphy_Have></span>What Did Shannon Sharpe and Nicole Murphy Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shannon Sharpe has been romantically linked to Nicole Murphy, the former wife of Eddie Murphy. Speculations about their relationship arose when they were spotted on a date in 2017. Before their outing, Shannon posted tweets about Nicole for several months, leading many fans to believe he was interested in her. However, it was nothing more than a fling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Capture-1.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Shannon_Sharpe_Have></span>How Many Kids Does Shannon Sharpe Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shannon has three kids from different women. Kayla and Kaley are his daughters, and Kiari is his son. The mothers of his daughters aren’t known. However, Kiari’s mother is known to be Erika Evans. Kiari was born in 1992, just two years after Shannon began his professional NFL career. He attended Georgia Southern University, where he studied psychology and business management.</p><p>Shannon’s first daughter, Kayla, was also born in 1992. She pursued pre-law at Georgia Southern University and works as an HR business partner at Phoebe Putney Health System. She is dedicated to advocating for business professionals, improving employee experiences, and creating positive working environments.</p><p>There is little to no detail about Shannon’s youngest daughter, Kaley. Her birth date and her mother’s identity have not been reported. However, Kaley studied at Florida State University to become a medical examiner. She completed her medical degree at Indiana University in 2022.</p><p>Shannon isn’t the only celebrity who has been involved in numerous relationships. <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> dated six high-profile women and was once married to Katies Holmes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwKmtzaemp2Wjna6zvMSsZLChlpp6orrDZqmepJGptrC60qGgqatdmba0r86vnKuhnpx6tbTEZqCdnZ6ptrXFjKidZqWiqHq0tMCrp55n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshannon-sharpes-wife-and-relationships-discovering-the-identity-of-mrs-sharpe.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./triple-berry-summer-buttermilk-bundt-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./triple-berry-summer-buttermilk-bundt-2.html>triple-berry-summer-buttermilk-bundt</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rodan-fields-pore-cleansing-md-review.html>Rodan + Fields Pore Cleansing MD Review for Blackhead-Prone Skin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rodan-fields-pore-cleansing-md-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
