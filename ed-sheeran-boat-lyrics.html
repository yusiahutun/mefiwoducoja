This album in particular was planned to be a stripped-down set with a majority of acoustic songs. With help from The National’ Aaron Dessner (who he was introduced to, none other than by bestie <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Swift)</a>, he crafted one of his rawest and vulnerable music to date.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/billie-eilish-what-was-i-made-for-lyrics.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dua-Lipa-_Dance-The-Night-lyrics-1.jpg><p>In celebration of the release of the album and winning a court case where it was alleged that he plagiarised Marvin Gaye, Ed made a touching <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram post.</a> “I made this album as a way to make sense of things that go on inside my head, and immensely proud of it,” he wrote. “I woke up this morning and just felt lighter. Lighter that the album is in the world, and lighter that people are connecting with it on such a deep and meaningful level. The only thing I want from this album is that people feel something when they listen to it. It makes us all feel less alone when we realise our most embarrassing, darkest feelings are things that everyone goes through. I feel so grateful to have been able to work with <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=# rel=nofollow>@aarondessner</a> on this project, he brought out a side of me I buried down, out of fear and fake bravado, and helped me create something that I know will be one of the most important albums in my discography for many reasons.”</p><p>Ed also revealed that he wrote even more songs in his sessions with Aaron Dessner. &nbsp;“It was very quickly seen that we were making two different things,” he said in a cover story with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>. He went on to write an entirely separate second album with The National frontman. He’s already mixing that one, though he’s not sure when it will come out; he wants to give – a chance to breathe. “I have no goals for the record,” he says. “I just want to put it out.”</p><p>On working with him, the National musician told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>,&nbsp;“He’s made giant pop records that are easy to criticise, but on a human and artistic level, he’s so gifted and lovely. It couldn’t have been more natural, fun and rewarding to feel him jumping off the cliff with me. Over time, I’ve tired of the ‘what’s cool?’ debate.”</p><p>So what does “Boat” by Ed Sheeran mean?

According to Ed, the song is&nbsp;“basically a song about resilience.”</p><p>“Feeling at your lowest and wondering if you can get through it, basically,” he posted on his Instagram. “I wrote the song and finished it by the English seaside, which is, I think, very beautiful, but it is quite a bleak and cold place in winter. I was looking out at the sea and these crashing waves crashing down, and I sort of felt like that was a good metaphor of what was happening at the time with me. And that’s where the line ‘The waves won’t break my boat’ came from.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-a-font-body-l">“’Boat’ is the first song I wrote and finished for&nbsp;Subtract,” the “A-Team” singer said in a statement. “It’s where it all began, and a good way to kick off the album.”</p><h2>Ed Sheeran “Boat” Lyrics</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Here are Ed Sheeran’s “Boat” <a href=# id=auto-tag_lyrics data-tag=lyrics>Lyrics</a>, courtesy of<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Genius</a>.</p><p>[Verse 1]<br>Came in for the embers<br>Stayed out for the breeze<br>I need to feel elements to remind me<br>There’s beauty when it’s bleak</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>Stuck out long before lights down<br>Why do I breathe?
