Some have carefully calculated this exit from Hollywood to coincide with the peak of their careers. In this way, they can shape their legacies by making sure that their best roles remain their most memorable. Other stars have announced “retirements” only to try to make a comeback that didn’t pan out.&nbsp;There are many celebrities who are now living much quieter lives who nonetheless have been able to create comfortable and fulfilling careers.&nbsp;Bo Derek’s acting career definitely stalled out, but the former model has now turned her attention to another fulfilling project.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bo-Derek.jpg><h2 id=h-bo-derek-was-a-superstar-in-the-1980s>Bo Derek was a superstar in the 1980s</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_91>In 1979, the film&nbsp;10 released. <a href=#>The romantic comedy</a> follows the spiral of a middle-aged couple as the protagonist (played by Dudley Moore) becomes obsessed with a newly married younger woman. This lust interest is portrayed by Bo Derek, and the film helped launch Derek into sex symbol status.&nbsp;The actor would go on to some notable roles throughout the 1980s including&nbsp;Tarzan the Ape Man,&nbsp;Bolero, and&nbsp;Ghosts Can’t Do It. While none of her films stand out as particularly noteworthy blockbusters, she had a steady career in acting that stretched on into the 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_83>Several of the films were made alongside her husband John Derek. Controversially, Bo Derek was only 17 when she began dating John Derek, who was 46 years old. In an interview with&nbsp;Variety, Bo Derek says that looking back, she doesn’t want anyone to misconstrue her relationship with her husband, who died in 1998: “It felt right at the time. I was so in love with him and we ended up together for 25 years. I’m just so grateful he was a good person.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-bo-derek-is-in-a-partnership-with-actor-john-corbett>Bo Derek is in a partnership with actor John Corbett</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-4_79>Bo Derek remained married to John Derek until his death in 1998. A few years later, she began a relationship with actor John Corbett, who became very <a href=#>well known for portraying Aidan</a> — Carrie’s other “big” love — in&nbsp;Sex and the City. The couple enjoys a long and meaningful relationship, but when pressed about why they’ve never made it official with a walk down the aisle, Derek makes it clear that it’s not a step they’ve felt they need.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_87>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a> reports, Derek explained, “When you’re beginning a young family and you’re going to have children and set up this new family tree branch, [marriage is] obviously a wonderful commitment and it’s meaningful. But for us in our lives, it hasn’t been yet.” She went on to gush about the relationship they do have. “He’s full of life, full of joy. I became attracted to him and I still am. We take things day by day and I think we are still there,” the actor explained.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-bo-derek-s-net-worth>What is Bo Derek’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_56>Bo Derek’s acting career often veered into films of questionable quality. In fact, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> demonstrates, most of her awards are in the form of Razzies. She’s been nominated multiple times (including for the 2000 Worst Actress of the Century title — <a href=#>the “honor” went to Madonna</a>).&nbsp;Acting isn’t the only focus for the former star, however.</p><p id=par-7_95>While her more recent forays onto a set have been minor roles or in universally panned films — like&nbsp;Sharknado 3 — she has other ways to fill her time. In 2000, she launched Bless the Beasts, a pet care line that sold at PetCo stores, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Petage</a>.&nbsp;That product line underwent a rebranding and came out as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bo Derek Pet Care</a>, a brand that provides conditioner, shampoo, and face wash for pets.&nbsp;Between her acting and modeling career and her business ventures, Derek has amassed an impressive net worth of $40 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6sLDEpWSam6Skv26uzmabnqqVoHqvu9ZmpZ6sXay8s8DHZ5%2BtpZxk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmodel-actor-bo-derek-now-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-facts-about-tea.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-facts-about-tea.html>15 Facts About Tea - Facts.net</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-view-stephen-king-halloween-costumes-whoopi-mccain.html>The View Tackles Stephen King Characters for Halloween 2019</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-view-stephen-king-halloween-costumes-whoopi-mccain.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
