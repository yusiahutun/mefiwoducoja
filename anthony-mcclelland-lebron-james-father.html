While Anthony was primarily absent in James’s life, however, Gloria played a vital role in seeing him successful. While growing up, the athlete did not get to have a healthy father-son relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/james-357.jpg><p>McClelland had an extensive criminal history. Even though he did not pay for child support, leaving Gloria to look after LeBron on her own. It was not easy to get to the top due to his difficult upbringing; today, he is at the peak of his fame.</p><p>So they have to move from one apartment to another because Gloria struggled to get a stable job. This person, who is called LeBron father, was not there for LeBron or his mother in their time of need.</p><h4><strong>You may like </strong><a href=#><strong>Leslie Mann Spouse (Judd Apatow) Age, Movies, Net Worth, Kids, Ig >></strong></a></h4><p>Gloria lived with her mother, Freda James, her grandmother, and two brothers. She had to raise herself, her son, and her brothers all by herself after the death of her grandmother and mother.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Age_and_Height></span><strong><u>Age and Height</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Anthony was born on 23rd November 1972 in Akron, Ohio, the United States of America, where he did his growing up. He is now 50 years old. Similarly, McClelland stands for 6’2″ tall and weighs about 75 kgs.</p><p>His body measurements are 42-34-32 inches. LeBron’s biological father wears a shoe size of 11 (US). His sexual orientation is straight, and he holds American citizenship.</p><p>In like manner, his eyes are dark brown, and his hair color is black. The NBA player’s father belongs of African-American descent and the catholic religion. Moreover, Anthony has a zodiac sign of Pisces.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Spouse></span><strong><u>Spouse</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the past years, Anthony and Gloria were in a casual relationship when she gave birth to their son, LeBron. Although James’s mother was only sixteen at the time and Anthony was not the most supportive father.</p><p>After all, Anthony was not there in their life; his absence of Anthony made James’ motivation to work even harder and follow his dreams with unending passion. So, his NBA star son does not recall any memories with him, and they don’t even share the same surname.</p><h4><strong>You may like </strong><a href=#><strong>Dreka Gates (Kevin Gates Wife) Age, Kids, Net Worth, Farm, Ig >></strong></a></h4><p>Even though there was also a time James’s mother had to leave him under the care of his football coach Frank Walker at 9, however, life was very hard, and she had no choice but to allow him to live in a stable home.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Children></span><strong><u>Children</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Besides LeBron, it is reported that McClelland had a son named Aaron McCelland Gamble with another woman. In 1987 Aaron was born in LeBron’s hometown Akron, Ohio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/james-358.jpg><p>However, Anthony did not take responsibility for Aaron either, instead choosing to leave him and his mother behind. However, Aaron has tried to get in touch with his supposed half-brother.</p><p>But it seems LeBron is not interested, even a bit, in forming a relationship with him. As LeBron is a millionaire, many people falsely claim to be related to James in hopes of getting monetary support.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><strong><u>Career</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Moving through Anthony’s career, there is minimal information on Anthony McClelland his professional career.</p><p>In the past years, LeBron’s father, McClelland led the wrong path from a very young age, so we can even assume he could not earn a decent living.</p><p>However, he was arrested for crimes like arson and theft in 2002. Anthony was constantly going in and out of prison for pretty crimes.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Roland_Bivens_LeBron_James_Father_Conspiracy></span><strong><u>Roland Bivens: LeBron James Father Conspiracy</u></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is one of the talks of the town. There are a lot of controversies that have been going around regarding the father of Lebron James. Some sources claim that LeBron James’s father’s name is Roland Bivens.</p><p>Hardly has there been any confirmation of this news, but the controversy has flown around the park quite a lot. Similarly to LeBron, Bivins was also a basketball player in his high school days.</p><p>With Bivens and the mother of LeBron James, Gloria going to the same school, the doubt tends to get better. The conspiracy rises to Bivens and Anthony being the same man. However, Bivens died in 1994, with Anthony went to prison in 2002.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_LeBron_James_Early_Life></span><strong><u>Who is LeBron James?
