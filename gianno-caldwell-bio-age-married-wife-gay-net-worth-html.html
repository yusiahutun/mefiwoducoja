The founder of the Washington-based firm, Caldwell Strategic Consulting, Gianno also provides advice and practical solutions to government, non-government organizations and the private sector.</p><p>While his long career is known aspect to all,&nbsp;there are still several aspects of his personal life unknown to his fans and viewers.</p><p>Why don't you follow the Gianno Caldwell's portfolio unveiling his dating status, family and bio-related details! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Marital Status, Girlfriend Exists?</h2><p>Gianno has no history of having a wife. Further, his hypothetical married life is also hidden under the wraps.&nbsp;</p><p>Gianno, age&nbsp;31, has not revealed any details of being committed in a relationship and the only mention he has done regarding his love life is a satirical Instagram post dedicated towards an ex-girlfriend. On 19 January 2018, Gianno shared a post in which he showed the portrayal of a crazy ex-lover. He captioned it describing a girl never reveals her anger by words, but instead, she will destroy things a man is attached to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Gianno talks about habits of crazy</strong><strong> ex-girlfriend </strong>(Photo: Gianno Caldwell's Instagram)</p><p>Whether Gianno was implicating his humor or talking about an actual woman, remains a mystery. However, in the recent time, he has not been linked to an&nbsp;affair which has left many wondering if the&nbsp;6'&nbsp;3"&nbsp;(1.91&nbsp;m) tall analyst is gay and hiding in the closet. This riddle can only be solved once Gianno admits to his sexuality or reveals a girlfriend.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite an absent dating life, his private aspect is not affected as Gianno shares a close relationship with his family members.</p><h2>Flaunting Lovely Family On Social Media</h2><p>Gianno is a family man in every sense and enjoys flaunting his folks relentlessly on social media. He has dedicated several posts towards his family members. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On 27 January 2017, he shared an old picture with his dad both dressed in matching suits and revealed the importance of suit which his father had taught him. Further, the Illinois-native had also mentioned of having a big sister with whom he attends Opera House regularly. Moreover, on 9 March 2017, he shared a photo with his mother identifying her as "Momma B."</p><p></p><p><strong>Gianno shares a lovely bond with his mother</strong> (Photo: Gianno Caldwell's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Gianno also has a tender spot in his heart for his deceased grandma and misses her a lot. On 23 January, he shared a post via&nbsp;Instagram in which he expressed his remembrance of his grandmother and further mentioned that no matter how many years passed, he would still be missing her.</p><p>Moreover, the political trailblazer&nbsp;is a proud brother, who mentioned on 23 May 2018 that his younger sibling Christian was already interested in college despite only attending 8th grade at the time.</p><p>Gianno has also talked about his other brother, Matthew, who is 17 years old.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As of 2018, Gianno is living a comfortable life with a lovely family. Further, he is financially independent earning&nbsp;a salary ranging from&nbsp;$41,115 to $44,912 which is the average revenue of Fox News' Political Analyst, however, the amount of his net worth is not disclosed.</p><p>Seems like&nbsp;the only thing lacking behind for Gianno is the existence of a girlfriend and once found, the political contributor might bring more&nbsp;happiness in his life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqChkaO7sHnCmqOdr5WhuW6uyKhkmp%2BVYrqivtGinJ1lp56zpnnGmrBmppWperi70a2fZ6Ckork%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgianno-caldwell-bio-age-married-wife-gay-net-worth-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./local-events.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./local-events.html>Local Events | leader-call.com</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./design-trends-nest-refresh.html>Design Trends: Nest Refresh</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./design-trends-nest-refresh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
