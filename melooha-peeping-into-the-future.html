With the advent of technology, numerous astrology apps are available on smartphones that allow people to access personalized horoscopes, birth charts, and astrological insights right at their fingertips.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Melooha</strong></a>, an innovative AI astrology app, emerges as a hyper-personalized SaaS platform designed to transcend the constraints of language and time zones, providing real-time, precise & credible guidance.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Navigating Diverse Roles in Entrepreneurship and Leadership</h2><p><strong>Vikram Labhe (Founder & CEO of Melooha)</strong> sets the vision for the company and spearheads it by wearing multiple hats.. He takes on responsibilities encompassing Product, GTM, Analytics, PR, and more. He is the bridge between diverse facets, ensuring a seamless blend of vision and execution.</p><p>Being a serial entrepreneur, Vikram has a strong career background. Before starting Melooha, he held a pivotal leadership role in the scale-up of Fivetran, a data pipeline startup that now boasts 5000+ global customers and a valuation of $5.6 billion. Prior to that, he had profitably built & sold another startup.&nbsp;</p><p>Vikram started his career at PMC Sierra, a semiconductor product company in Vancouver, Canada. In 2005, he moved back to Bangalore, India, as the first employee tasked with establishing PMC’s India R&D center. Over the next decade, Vikram transformed that into the world’s largest center, with a workforce of ~1000, spread across Bangalore & Hyderabad.&nbsp;</p><p>Vikram holds a BE from Nagpur University, an MS from Simon Fraser University (Canada), and is also an alumnus of IIM Bangalore. His achievements also include a US patent and numerous technical publications.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The First Step towards Living Dreams</h2><p>Vikram’s mother introduced him to the ancient practice of Astrology in his childhood, and he has been intrigued by this field ever since. Access to talented astrologers helped him to extend the outcomes of the “peaks” while minimizing the impact of the “valleys” in his life-journeys. As a result, astrology evolved into a guiding force in his life, offering direction on crucial choices and enhancing his self-awareness.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is hard to find talented & credible astrologers with a consistent and accessible presence. According to Vikram, “Astrology is not something that students who only pass a rigorous testing methodology are capable of absorbing and applying knowledge – Like the prestigious IITs or IIMs or IAS. You don’t know if your astrologer has had the capability and capacity to learn Astrology from a scientific perspective.” This realization sparked the idea in Vikram’s mind to break down astrology into a series of specific mathematical algorithms, supported by accurate planetary information available today, including from NASA.</p><p>By using the latest available deep tech (AI), he decided to solve the issues with the unregulated nature of astrology, including quality, credibility, time zones, and accessibility.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Birth & Evolution of Melooha</h2><p>To ensure the feasibility of implementing astrology using technology, Vikram delved into studying the subject in-depth through books and educational videos. Thus, he discovered that astrology is rooted in mathematics and algorithms, making it suitable for implementation using tech-driven solutions. With this realization, he took the first step toward making astrology a scalable and accessible life management tool.</p><p>To bring Melooha to life, Vikram needed a team of experts with complimentary skills. Finding a trusted astrologer to join him on this journey was a crucial first step. Fortunately, he had the privilege of consulting with a highly experienced astrologer who had a Ph.D. in Astrology, numerous publications, and extensive teaching experience. <strong>Dr. Vineeta Phatak</strong>, the co-founder, and an accomplished Astrologer, joined Vikram and brought her immense domain expertise and insights.</p><p>To establish the founding team, a technical co-founder was needed, and that’s where <strong>Bhalchandra Patil</strong> (Bhala) entered the picture. With 25 years of experience in building B2B & B2C software products and teams, Bhala was the perfect fit. He joined Melooha as the technical co-founder and his hands-on experience along with his leadership qualities made him an invaluable addition to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Melooha today has an exceptional team of dedicated leaders encompassing the diverse functions including GTM, UX/UI, Analytics, and more!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Credible Source of Guidance</h2><p>Seeking guidance is one of the basic human needs. People go to their friends, family, God, and sometimes to professionals like psychologists and astrologers to fulfill this need.&nbsp;</p><p>Melooha is built to be “<strong>The Trusted & Credible Guide for Every Human Being on the Planet”</strong>. It provides personalized guidance based on an individual’s unique birth details, including their specific date, place, and time of birth.&nbsp;</p><p>The proof of concept, executed with the utmost success, came to fruition in March 2023. The iOS and Android apps are now live for general use. They have been designed keeping in mind that at any time, a user may either have very specific questions that they need guidance on, or are faced with a life-event which has many dimensions and so require a comprehensive report.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>User-Centric Offerings</h2><p>Currently, Melooha has two product offerings:</p><p><strong>Questions: </strong>This offering is for people who have specific questions. Some examples of the questions are:</p><ul><li>When will I get married?</li><li>Will I be rich?</li><li>How will be my stress this month?</li></ul><p>In this interface, users can inquire about the most pressing questions on their minds. They have the option to select questions from a suggested list or type their own questions. Melooha engine promptly processes algorithms and provides real-time answers.</p><p><strong>Reports:</strong> This service is tailored for individuals seeking guidance on intricate situations that typically require answers to multiple questions. Melooha assumes the responsibility of alleviating users from the task of contemplating which questions to pose in such complex scenarios. Some examples of the reports are:</p><ul><li><strong>Personality</strong>: This report helps empower the user with self-awareness, by providing them insights into their strengths & weaknesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Romance</strong>: This report provides an overview of the user’s love life, emphasizing auspicious times, potential challenges, and much more!:&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wealth</strong>: This report blends astrological insights with actionable advice, helping users make informed decisions in their financial journey.</li></ul><p>Users have the flexibility to access the report within the app or download it as a PDF. Melooha is committed to delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, offering real-time answers to specific questions and detailed reports that cater to evolving situations. As a customer-centric app, Melooha prioritizes the user’s needs and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blending Ancient Wisdom with Machine Learning&nbsp;</h2><p>Melooha takes pride in its deep technical skill-set which has enabled the app to build algorithms true to the definition of machine-learning. The algorithms are built on ancient texts and the company has tried to remain true to the interpretation by working with well-respected and erudite astrologers. These algorithms can be learned and improved over time through feedback provided by the users. Additionally, Melooha enables natural language interfaces powered by in-house algorithms working in tandem with LLMs.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the “<strong>World’s Most Accurate Astrology Engine</strong>”, Melooha’s credibility & accuracy is at the core of its functioning.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, there are certain life events that humans should not get answers to, like “timing of death”. Moreover, certain ethical questions should not be answered, like “Will I be able to commit a certain crime”. Melooha has taken a conscious call not to guide on any such life events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Impact of AI on Astrophysics&nbsp;</h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=3.5><tr readability=7><td><strong>A bridge between wisdom and technology</strong>The fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Astrology has ushered in a new era of celestial exploration, revolutionizing how Melooha perceives and engages with this ancient practice.
