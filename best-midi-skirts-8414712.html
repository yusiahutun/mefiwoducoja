But if there’s one style that transcends trends, it’s the midi skirt. Timeless and effortless, its length is the perfect in-between, a reliable option that can easily be dressed up or down and worn year-round.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the term “midi skirt” is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of shapes, silhouettes, and lengths, so long as they hit somewhere below the knee and above the ankle. Slinky silk slips can count as one, as can flared A-line styles. A long, tailored pencil skirt? Yup, also a midi. All that’s to say, finding the one that suits both your sartorial needs and body type means navigating the ever-vast midi skirt market. To narrow it down to only the best in show, we consulted a team of stylists and tastemakers to share their insights and picks.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-reformation-zoe-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Zoe Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Zoe Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RV7mKVogQ0H1F1_wRE7wy0TRB6A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-zoe-skirt-10669a28e0994f099f99a672a5e18969.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This ever-versatile, universally flattering midi can be dressed up or down effortlessly.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s dry clean only and can’t be thrown in the wash.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Reformation midi skirt is easy, effortless, and universally flattering, which is why we’re ranking it at the very top of this list. It’s designed with a simple A-line silhouette — a fitted waist and slightly flared, relaxed skirt — which, in addition to complementing all body types, is a timeless silhouette, earning itself a long-term spot at the front of our closets. It’s crafted with a drapey crepe fabric that doesn’t lean too casual or too formal, making it suitable for a wide range of sartorial situations, while a high (but not too high) leg slit shows off a little skin without being overly sexy, deeming it an apt addition to workwear and night-out wardrobes alike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most importantly, it’s available in an inclusive size range, which includes extended and petite sizes in addition to straight sizes. Have your pick from a variety of colorways, from solid black to a range of pretty florals — you really can’t go wrong with whichever you choose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Viscose, rayon | <strong>Size: </strong>0–24; petite | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-coated-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Coated Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Coated Skirt " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gFVyDlPbqplj-PkMeTGnEkutgwQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hm-coated-skirt-d1aabd0c6aa44d8faeccd6c94bc3a5ac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This coated, distressed midi skirt is an edgier take on the denim maxi skirt trend.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The coating may wear off with frequent washing.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s any trend that will be long associated with 2024, it’s the denim skirt — particularly those of the midi and maxi varieties — which began making its rounds among the street style set earlier this year. If you haven’t hopped on the trend just yet, we have good news: it’s showing no signs of slowing down, and now is a better time than ever to partake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love this black iteration from H&M, which features a distressed, wax-like coating, lending it an edgier feel than its classic blue denim counterparts. Its mid-rise waist and front slit make it a comfortable, easy piece for every day, and because it has a leather-like finish, it can just as easily pair with a night-out top as it can a basic cotton tee. Take the price point into consideration, and it’s pretty much a no-brainer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane | <strong>Size: </strong>0–20 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold, line dry; no dry clean, no iron<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pleated-jcrew-pleated-skirt-with-gold-buttons></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pleated</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Pleated Skirt with Gold Buttons</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Pleated Skirt with Gold Buttons" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nQLmg24z9m6ylVWNRFDL4W064_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-pleated-skirt-with-gold-buttons-826b6a5a014c42b29b4403f584bca2f3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This simple pleated midi skirt features side buttoning for an adjustable leg slit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something about a pleated midi skirt that feels so elegant, especially when compared to its academia-inspired mini counterparts. A timeless skirt style that surpasses the ever-changing trend cycle, it’s an easy, not-so-basic basic that has the ability to instantly make any outfit look more put together, whether you pair it with low-top sneakers or buttery knee-high leather boots. This fluttery option from J.Crew ranks high on our list thanks to statement side buttoning that allows its wearer to adjust the height of the leg slit — show a little leg, a lot of leg, or none at all! We also love that it’s available in an inclusive size range and three colors: effortless black and white and a punchy teal shade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>00–24 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sequin-madewell-sequin-midi-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sequin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Sequin Midi Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Sequin Midi Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Aw1_F8QOTy_nV18GFImCXHwHWpc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-sequin-midi-skirt-a599aeabdaeb4af69eaf7794613c0a5c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This georgette pencil skirt is covered in clear sequins for a pared-down (but still plenty sparkly) party look.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is anything more synonymous with holiday party dressing than sequins? We’re big fans of sparkly party attire, but we can’t deny that we tend to ignore them as soon as it hits January 2. That’s why we’re big fans of this midi from Madewell, a nude georgette pencil skirt that’s decked out in clear sequins rather than the traditional metallic we’re used to seeing. The result? A glamorous yet pared-down party look that doesn’t feel so holiday that it’s deemed unwearable the rest of the year. Sure, it’s a fabulous choice for ringing in the new year, but it’s just as appropriate to wear to a summertime soirée or a springtime garden party. Sequins aside, we also appreciate the back slit, which allows for easy movement and a comfortable fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>00–16 | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-the-row-alumo-scuba-midi-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Row Alumo Scuba Midi Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Row Alumo Scuba Midi Skirt " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1DoNjzTrg7ThqfppPYXk-VF2cIY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-row-alumo-scuba-midi-skirt--92ecb2af942b4ee98cd61722bce3bf06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-a-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This structured scuba midi skirt is sleek, timeless, and super flattering.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The style runs large.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going to spend a pretty penny on a skirt, make it something that’s equally as versatile as it is high quality, ensuring you get plenty of wear and bang for your buck. This pencil skirt from The Row is just that, deeming it worth its upper-triple-digit price tag — which, coming from a brand known for masterful tailoring, luxurious fabrics, and sophisticated, minimalist designs, isn’t that surprising. The simple pull-on style is designed to fit slim at the hips with a slightly flared hemline, which holds its shape thanks to a sturdy, non-stretch scuba material (and is extra comfortable thanks to the center-hem back slit). Overall, it’s an elegant option that’s bound to work with just about any combination of tops and shoes you already own.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane; cotton lining | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-faux-leather-tanya-taylor-salma-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Faux-Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tanya Taylor Salma Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tanya Taylor Salma Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GW7adNm8fJKK9JNa98RX2fnRQms=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tanya-taylor-salma-skirt-5200becc1b23419c9bde91eeefb4758d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tanya Taylor</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The croc-stamped faux leather on this midi has a super luxurious look and feel.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some reviews say it runs large despite being listed as true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As many brands move towards using vegan fabrics over animal-derived materials, contemporary and luxury included, there’s truly no shortage of faux leather midi skirts to choose from, whether you prefer pencil, pleated, or A-line silhouettes. Still, not all faux leathers are created equal, and while some perfectly imitate buttery-soft, supple real leather, many others have a stiff, plastic-like look and feel. All that’s to say, Tanya Taylor absolutely nailed it with this croc-embossed iteration, a calf-length style that’s polished enough for the office and stylish enough for a fancy dinner date. The straight silhouette is on the slimmer side without being too fitted, while a high front center slit ensures you can comfortably move in it (perfect for subway work commutes). We also love that it’s available in more unconventional hues than the usual blacks, browns, and creams — a deep navy is inherently neutral with a subtle hint of color, while mustard yellow is sure to stand out no matter how you style it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>00–22 | <strong>Care: </strong>Hand wash cold, then line dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-silk-veronica-beard-sorelle-stretch-silk-charmeuse-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Silk</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veronica Beard Sorelle Stretch-Silk Charmeuse Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veronica Beard Sorelle Stretch-Silk Charmeuse Skirt " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f1VeSzF9y48x7STMecMZ0zkr3Vc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/veronica-beard-sorelle-stretch-silk-charmeuse-skirt--c1e78b7cf18c493ab8d3d6c3c70f0cbd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Veronica Beard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This luxe silk slip skirt has a bit of stretch for a comfortable fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The elastic waistband may stretch out over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ever-versatile, a silk skirt is one of those staple pieces you’ll hold onto forever, fitting seamlessly into a variety of looks, from dressy date night ensembles to casual brunch ‘fits. Many brands have put their spin on the classic style, but personal stylist Desiree Miranda counts this Veronica Beard option as a favorite. “It’s made with a stretch silk charmeuse that’s thick enough to where you won’t see through it, and it doesn’t fit so snug that it’ll reveal more than we like,” she says. Because it’s constructed with bias cut seaming and the silk is blended with 8% spandex, it has a flattering fit with a decent amount of stretch and fluid, flowy movement. The glossy finish feels super luxe and adds a polished feel to any look, but it’s not so dressy that you can’t pair it with a chunky knit sweater and sneakers, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Silk, spandex | <strong>Size: </strong>00–16 | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-floral-free-people-garden-party-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Floral</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Garden Party Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Garden Party Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h0dmJo9MdU9DqGaP7yzMDFb1Fl8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/free-people-garden-party-skirt-3a1e7c3001034b3697a79284e7768978.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This fluttery floral skirt is more Y2K grunge than cutesy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some reviewers say it runs large.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Can’t decide what to wear? A floral midi skirt is a fail-safe option for when you can’t make up your mind, a non-basic essential we think everyone should have at their disposal. We love that this particular style from Free People leans a little more grunge than girly, thanks to its vintage-inspired prints, low-rise scalloped waistline, and billowy asymmetrical hem — throw on your favorite pair of Docs, and you’re good to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciate that, unlike many floral skirts that tend to be categorized as either fall- or spring-appropriate, this rose print is pretty seasonless, pairing just as nicely with tights and a sweater as it does with a tank and sandals. Moreover, the print comes in four colorways, so there’s plenty of opportunity to find one that works with your existing wardrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, viscose | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cargo-marc-jacobs-the-cargo-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cargo</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Marc Jacobs The Cargo Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Marc Jacobs The Cargo Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4rcwI6zc3PV1h-TuBF0nh3AW_yc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/marc-jacobs-the-cargo-skirt-ab8d0fc578024e1696d69b9af2bc1b36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Marc Jacobs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The length of this sporty cargo skirt is adjustable thanks to drawstring side ruching.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It might overpower petite body types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Y2K revival</a> has brought some polarizing style choices back into the spotlight, a great example being cargo pants. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, there’s no denying the hold all things utilitarian have on fashion right now, which explains the comeback of an even more unexpected trend: the cargo skirt. Straight out of the early aughts, this style from Marc Jacobs is not for the faint of heart: It’s crafted from structured taffeta, features drawstring side ruching allowing its wearer to adjust the length, and is designed with all the pockets one can dream of (six total). It’s arguably not the easiest thing to style, so we suggest keeping the rest of your look simple — think baby tees and minimalist flats or sneakers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, nylon | <strong>Size: </strong>00–12 | <strong>Care: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-denim-still-here-panama-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Denim</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Still Here Panama Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Still Here Panama Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iJsXdPtFEWi_b__-hgvv_oQADJ4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/still-here-panama-skirt-2a89b5d733514ee0b155cfe28fae21aa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This simple light-wash denim skirt is an effortless, versatile basic.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The traditional button fly may not lay as flat as a zipper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the long denim skirt trend showing no signs of slowing down, we recommend investing in a style that’s simple and uncomplicated to ensure you’ll get plenty of wear out of it. Our pick? This midi from buzzy denim label Still Here. Light wash with traditional five-pocket styling, this skirt is a no-fuss wardrobe essential you can easily swap in for a pair of jeans, pairing seamlessly with your favorite sweaters, tees, and bodysuits. It’s nice and structured, made with heavyweight, non-stretch denim for a flattering fit, and hits at or just above the ankle, depending on your height. On paper, that may sound restricting, but fear not: It features split side hems and a knee-high front slit that ensure it’s comfortable and allows for ease of movement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton | <strong>Size: </strong>23–32 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-summer-nia-thomas-baja-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Summer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nia Thomas Baja Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nia Thomas Baja Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mc7l1D9bXzD_P2sJhveuZJq4LH4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nia-thomas-baja-skirt-04b27fcbaef8428d80979524abdfe248.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nia Thomas</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This airy wrap skirt can be worn in three ways.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s very sheer, so some may find it too revealing.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it’s sweltering outside, the lighter and flowier our clothing, the better — which is why we have our eyes on this breezy beauty from Nia Thomas. Inspired by the ’70s Studio 54 era, it’s crafted from 100% silk chiffon that flows with the body and boasts a gorgeous sheen, making it truly a showstopper. Light, airy, and ultra-sheer, the wrap silhouette can be tied in three ways for plenty of styling versatility, meaning it’ll get plenty of wear during warm-weather months.

This style from Mango is a favorite of plus-size stylist and image consultant Michaela Leitz for both its versatility and inclusive size range. “What makes it so special is that it’s available in sizes XXS to 4XL and truly delivers on style without breaking the bank,” she says. “It’s a versatile gem that can be dressed up for an evening with a chic blouse or dressed down with a cozy sweater.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s available in three colors that can seamlessly fit into any wardrobe — black, gray, and a muted sage green — and we love how the shiny satin finish instantly makes any look feel a little bit fancy, no matter how casual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4XL | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash; do not dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leopard-printed-ganni-leopard-pleated-georgette-midi-flounce-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leopard-Printed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ganni Leopard Pleated Georgette Midi Flounce Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ganni Leopard Pleated Georgette Midi Flounce Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Payy9PpyUrSy7g66t29nL1lb3f0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ganni-leopard-pleated-georgette-midi-flounce-skirt-5e547e56ac0a4eb2984034943e7cf67d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ganni</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This fluttery leopard skirt may look dressy, but the easy, pull-on style makes it oh-so comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The elastic waistband may stretch out over time.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Never underestimate the power of the leopard midi skirt — remember when a certain slip iteration had New York City in such a chokehold that it sparked an entire <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Instagram account</a> dedicated to its countless sightings? Well, that may have been over four years ago, but we’re still fans of the wardrobe staple (leopard is neutral, right?), especially when it’s reimagined in interesting hemlines and cuts. Take this flouncy Ganni style, which is crafted with a pleated georgette fabric and features a ruffled, waterfall hemline that may be inherently fancy, but is designed with comfy features like a high slit and an elasticated waist for non-fussy wear. What’s more, we love that the fabric is derived from recycled polyester that’s lightweight enough to wear on hot summer days but easy to layer over a pair of warm tights during winter months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>0–14 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold with similar colors<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-linen--other-stories-strap-detail-linen-midi-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Linen</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>& Other Stories Strap Detail Linen Midi Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="&amp;amp; Other Stories Strap Detail Linen Midi Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lwlb-hnbqKMA-rsBWjHcpYWePl0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/other-stories-strap-detail-linen-midi-skirt-849d5d8d4e6248a8ae6c2780404f8360.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>& Other Stories</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Strappy details add a romantic, dressier feel to an otherwise casual style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The elastic waistband may stretch out over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When summer and its subsequent high temperatures and humidity index come around, we tend to gravitate towards wearing as little clothing as possible.

The elasticated waist and straps also allow for some styling versatility; you can wear high on the waist and tie the straps over the fabric for a cinching effect, or go full Y2K and wear slung low on the hips, tying the straps over a bare midriff for a sexier, “night-out” feel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Linen | <strong>Size: </strong>0–12 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold or dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-cos-polka-dot-taffeta-midi-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cos Polka-Dot Taffeta Midi Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="COS Polka-Dot Taffeta Midi Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bWy5p-im4A6iyHzIFl9AwFDY5Bc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cos-polka-dot-taffeta-midi-skirt-ec90b9a32da6409e8b6c9d4340ba9449.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>COS</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This voluminous taffeta midi makes a quiet statement thanks to its full silhouette, soft sheen, and tonal polka dot print.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may overpower petite body types.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full skirts, especially when midi length, have the power to be the star of your outfit, and we love that this voluminous option from Cos boasts a bit of structure, unlike its flowy, gathered-waist counterparts. Crafted from taffeta with a soft sheen and tonal polka dot print, it makes a big statement without being too in-your-face, appeasing both modest dressers and fashion risk-takers alike. What’s more, the taffeta is part-recycled, derived from pre- and post-consumer waste, upping its sustainability factor. Did we mention it also has pockets?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Striking the right balance is of utmost importance when styling a full skirt, especially a style as voluminous as this one.

Take this option from Aritzia’s Wilfred label, for example. Designed to hit mid-calf (though this will vary from person to person, depending on height), it boasts an A-line silhouette and high-rise waist, both of which complement most body types well. The partially recycled viscose-blend material makes this especially flattering — it’s softly structured so that it holds its shape, including its flared hemline, but also maintains a bit of stretch for an extra comfortable fit, especially at the zippered waistline. Style this with a blazer and boots for work, a slinky top for dinner, or even a cozy sweater and sneakers for running errands — the combinations are endless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, viscose, cotton, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>00–12 | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-asymmetrical-alc-navy-midi-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Asymmetrical</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>A.L.C.

While it may seem like more of a statement piece, it can be treated like any other tailored plaid skirt — pair it with your favorite turtleneck sweaters, bodysuits, or silky blouses for a polished look fit for work and after-work drinks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, wool, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>00–14 | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-knit-rails-diana-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Knit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rails Diana Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rails Diana Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4Qaj2jMrMYy67ZcypWuXvv0kg8A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rails-diana-skirt-e2988ca8078b41298c5c8ebe9759e974.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This knit midi is supremely soft and cozy yet still looks put together, an ideal choice for cold-weather dressing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s dry clean only and can’t be thrown in the wash.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every year, like clockwork, we find ourselves in a bit of a fashion rut as soon as temperatures begin to drop, wanting to reach for nothing but our coziest sweatpants. This skirt from Rails is the perfect solution for when we need to leave the house and look put together but still crave the comfort of our favorite indoor-only outfits. It’s made from a fuzzy mid-weight brushed knit for a luxurious hand feel that also keeps you nice and toasty (we’d honestly sleep in it) and features a front slit that shows just the right amount of leg. And unlike your sweats, it can easily be dressed up — just throw on a knee-high heeled boot and bodysuit, or pair it with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching pullover</a> for head-to-toe softness you’ll want to live in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Alpaca, acrylic, nylon, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fringe-lagence-karolina-faux-leather-fringe-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fringe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Agence Karolina Faux Leather Fringe Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L&amp;acirc;Agence Karolina Faux Leather Fringe Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QJh4cpYDzvzFHqPOuqiv6K-RpcQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lagence-karolina-faux-leather-fringe-skirt-0cde25386ab4484da75e52c0e76778ef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Designed with two tiers of fringe, this faux leather midi is the ultimate party skirt.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s dry clean only and can’t be thrown in the wash.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, fringe makes everything more fun, which is why we love this skirt from L’Agence. Sure, it may *technically* be considered a mini based on the above-the-knee hemline of the underskirt, but it features two fringed tiers that reach calf length, deeming it a midi in our book. Designed with a high-rise waist, back zip closure, and an A-line silhouette, it’ll not only serve as a sleek, show-stopping addition to your wardrobe, but it’s also flattering and timeless to boot. It’s crafted from buttery faux leather, making for a year-round event-ready style that’s fit for the holiday party circuit and summer soirees alike. Pair it with a cashmere turtleneck and tights or a silky tank and strappy sandals, depending on the season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–18 | <strong>Care: </strong>Dry clean<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Silhouette</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most important things to keep in mind when shopping for a midi skirt is the silhouette, as “midi” encompasses everything from flared and A-line to fitted, bodycon styles. What you feel most comfortable in is personal, but, as Kartvelishvili points out, understanding your body type can play a major factor in what silhouette you feel the most confident in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For an all-around universally flattering silhouette, Leitz recommends A-line styles — such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Wilfred’s Meyer Skirt</a> — adding that they’re also especially flattering for those who are heavier on top, as are flared styles that cinch at the waist. “This will create a balanced silhouette and draw attention away from the upper body and towards the lower half, creating a harmonious visual balance,” she says. “For those who are heavier on the bottom, a high-waisted midi skirt will highlight the narrowest part of your waist while flowing over your hips and thighs. A voluminous style will also balance out your proportions,” she says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Cos’ Polka-Dot Taffeta Midi Skirt</a> is a solid option. Curvy body types will benefit from the sleekness of a pencil skirt like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Dalood’s Mora Skirt</a>, which helps to highlight curves, while belted and pleated styles like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">J.Crew’s Pleated Skirt</a> can help create the illusion of curves for straight body shapes, she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to silhouette, length is also key. There are no set guidelines on how long or where exactly on the leg a midi skirt should hit, but rather a general range (more on that below), meaning there are various lengths on the market. While, again, it’s truly up to personal preference, Leitz and Kartvelishvili both suggest choosing a length based on your height for the most flattering fit. “If you’re tall, you can experiment with longer midi lengths that hit at the calf or even the ankle,” says Leitz. In this case, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">H&M’s Coated Skirt</a> is a great (and affordable) option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For petite individuals, a midi skirt that hits just below the knee can elongate your silhouette,” Leitz adds. Here, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Free People’s Garden Party Skirt</a> would do the trick. As for styling, pairing it with high heels can further enhance this effect. If your height falls somewhere in the middle, she says you have the flexibility to play around with different lengths “so long as you maintain balance in your outfit proportions.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Miranda, fabric is also one of the most important factors to consider. She recommends opting for textiles that are versatile and comfortable. “It shouldn’t be too sheer or thin of a fabric, and you’ll want it to double from day to night,” she says. “High-quality silk blends are usually my go-to, as well as anything with elastane, which will give the skirt some stretch for added comfort.” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Veronica Beard’s Sorelle Stretch-Silk Charmeuse Skirt</a> is a must for a quality, stretchy option. For a luxurious hand feel, Leitz recommends opting for velvet or satin (perfect for the holiday party season) and cotton or linen for stickier summer months, such as the&nbsp; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">& Other Stories Strap Detail Linen Midi Skirt</a>. “The fabric also affects the movement and flow of the skirt, so choose according to the look and feel you’re aiming for,” she adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Occasion</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, consider what occasion you plan to wear the skirt for. “Knowing where you’ll wear it will guide you to the right fabrics, colors, and brands to shop,” says Kartvelishvili. For example, a fully sequined skirt like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell’s option</a> will surely be a hit at your office holiday party, but it may not be apt for a regular day at the office. At the same time, a tailored workwear skirt may feel too stuffy for running errands or brunch with friends, whereas a comfy knitted style like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rails’ Diana Skirt</a> is on-trend and practical for both situations. Of course, you can’t go wrong with something versatile that can be dressed up or down, adds Miranda. “Skirts in neutral colors or timeless prints are easy to pair with different tops and accessories, giving you more mileage and ensuring your new skirt will remain a staple in your wardrobe,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long is a midi skirt?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A true midi skirt typically hits at mid-calf, hence the name ‘midi,’” explains Leitz. However, nowadays, “midi skirt” is more of a blanket term for any skirt that hits somewhere below the knee and above — even if just skimming — the ankle. “The key is that they’re longer than knee-length but shorter than full-length,” she says. All that’s to say, it’s important to figure out the length of the skirt and then take your height into consideration before clicking “purchase.” “Remember: everyone’s body is different, so a skirt that hits mid-calf on one person might be more of a maxi skirt on someone else,” she adds. Kartvelishvili recommends getting your midi skirts tailored to fit your needs and ensure they hit the most flattering part of your leg.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style a midi skirt?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of ways to wear a midi skirt, but the long-ish length can sometimes make it a tricky piece to style in terms of proportions — especially when it comes to footwear. “I don’t suggest wearing shorter booties with midi skirts, as this will shrink you and make your legs appear stubbier and wider than they are, says Miranda. Instead, Kartvelishvili recommends opting for shoe styles that elongate the leg, such as stiletto heels, pointed-toe flats, or under-the-knee boots — essentially, anything that won’t cut off your leg. Of course, the silhouette and material of the skirt will also determine what you ultimately pair with it, whether you dress it up with a silky, strappy top and heeled mules, a favorite look of Leitz, or pare it down with a scoop neckline tank and button down à la Kartvelishvili.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Igneri</a> is a freelance writer who has been working in fashion and beauty media for over a decade.
