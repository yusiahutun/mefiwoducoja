The actor, 44, played the role of Alex Poulous, introduced as the brother of Leah in 2001.</p><p>It wasn't met to be as the soap stars split the same year. The two starred together in Home and Away for six years until Danny left in 2007.</p><h3>Chrys Xipolitas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32085874.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Home-and-Away-Kirby-star-shows-off-curves-in-bikini-as-fans-swoon.jpg><p>In 2007, Ada married chef Chrys Xipolitas. It appeared their union had come to an end three years later when the couple separated. However, they reconciled the following month. The soap star and Chrys struggled to conceive a child and turned to IVF. In 2012, after more than two years of trying for a baby, they welcomed their first child; a son named Johnas.</p><p>Before Johnas turned two, the couple were delighted to discover they were expecting again. After hitting the 12-week mark in her pregnancy, Ada told New Idea: "For it to happen so quickly after we struggled for so long is a really nice surprise and we feel really, really lucky".</p><p>Tragically for the couple, their second child was stillborn. Ada opened up about the heartbreak of losing baby Harrison, admitting life "would never be the same" for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>In 2016, it was confirmed Ada and Chrys had split. The restauranteur moved out of their family home in November 2015, with a friend close to the pair admitting their marriage broke down as the anniversary of Harrison's death arrived.</p><p>“It all started going wrong around the one-year anniversary of Harrison’s passing in August,” a friend close to the family told Women's Day. "Chrys went into a Sydney clinic for six weeks because he hadn’t dealt with Harrison’s death properly. He has a history of depression and anxiety and losing a child was really tough on both of them."</p><p>Ada spoke publicly about the affect it had on their marriage. “We will never be the same people we were,” she said. “I just feel I can never be completely happy again because this has happened."</p><h3>Adam Rigby</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32144771.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Sapphire-Suite-2nd-Birthday-Party.jpg><p>Ada has been in a relationship with Adam Rigby since late 2016. The couple met at a work function – and Adam had no idea that his future partner was a huge star in Australia.</p><p>"It's kind of cool though, right?" she told New Idea. "I liked that he had no idea about the show." Ada went public with her new beau in 2018 when they attended the TV WEEK Logie Awards.</p><p>“It’s such a great night,” the star told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TV WEEK</a>. "And it’s always lovely to be able to share it with a partner. I love the Logies – it’s really special." Ada has praised the connection Adam shares with her son, confessing the pair "adore each other".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32144777.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_FOR-TONIGHT-Home-and-Away-Leah-stars-love-life.jpg><p>“Adam and Johnas adore each other; he’s such a great stepdad and has really stepped up,” she said in an interview with TV WEEK. “For a man to come into my world and love a child as if he were his own – and love me like I’ve never been loved before – is incredibly special."</p><p>Ada added: "I rely on him a lot, which is a real first for me. I’ve never been able to do that before; I’ve always held the reins. So it’s nice to know he has our back – he’s a great man."</p><p>The couple sparked engagement rumours last year after jetting off to a romantic European holiday. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>New Idea</a> at the time, the pair skipped the Logie Awards in favour of heading to Cyprus alongside 11-year-old Johnas.</p><p>The report speculated about a possible engagement after Ada confirmed to the publication that the trip was so Adam could meet her extended family.</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter.</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLWwucRmmLCZqWK5pq3HZqqtmaKoeq271Z5kbGphaYF2fZQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhome-away-leah-stars-love-32144515.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lee-kirk-bio-wiki-parents-siblings-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lee-kirk-bio-wiki-parents-siblings-net-worth.html>Lee Kirk Bio, Wiki, Age, Married, Wife, Children, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./case-walker-net-worth-age-height-girlfriend-career.html>Case Walker Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, &amp;amp; Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./case-walker-net-worth-age-height-girlfriend-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
