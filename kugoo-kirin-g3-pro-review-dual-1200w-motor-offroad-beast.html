But Kugoo said "oh no, we're not done yet", and made the G3 Pro... with another 1200W motor in the front.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right; the G3 Pro can be toggled into a dual motor mode for double the power (and double the fun). And it's absolutely insane. There is very little you can't conquer with this, yet it's still within an entirely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">budget-friendly price of $1549</a>. But you'll need to be quick—<strong>this is a preorder special discount of $150 off the final retail price</strong>.</p><h2 id=size-and-design>Size and Design</h2><p>Let's start with sizing first because the G3 Pro is massive and heavy, weighing 40kg (88lbs). Pictured below next to its baby brother the standard G3, it stands at roughly 1.3m or (51 inches long) and 1.36m (54 inches) tall when unfolded, while the handlebar is about 60cm (23.6 inches) wide. It’s big and imposing on those who behold it. For taller, bigger riders like me, the added height compared to your average adult escooter is fantastic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-rear-brake-and-suspension-detail.jpg><p>For comfort and safety, you have an extended, wider-than-average deck at 20 x 50cm (7.8 x 20 inches), and that's not including the rear stand, which you’ll almost certainly need to use to counteract the sheer power of the beast when taking off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-lights.jpg><p>There's very little construction needed out of the box: attach the handlebars to the stem using the bolts provided, and pump up the tires. The design style is very much similar to the standard G3 with gorgeous orange highlights and an overall tough, industrial, somewhat angry aesthetic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dual 1200W motors give an insane top speed of 40mph (65km/h). A 1206Wh removable battery backs that up, and it's that plus the motors where the majority of the 40kg weight comes from. With such a massive battery pack, you can also expect long charging times, at around 10 to 11 hours. If you're charging up overnight, this shouldn't be issue, and you're probably not depleting it on every ride either.</p><p>The G3 Pro features 10-inch all-terrain tires, air-filled for comfort. These are dual-purpose tires, though, rather than fully offroad knobbly tires. That means they'll perform equally as well on the road as off but will struggle on mud or other slippery surfaces (such as a pile of bark chippings).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-front-shot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also IP54 splash-resistant, so the odd bit of light rain and puddles aren't going to defeat you, but don't completely submerge it or leave it out during heavy rain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-foot-on-the-rear-stand-for-takeoff.jpg><p>The display is big and easy to read even in direct sun, with obvious indicators for current speed mode, dual or single motor, charge, and current voltage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-wear-a-full-face-helmet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=transport-and-range>Transport and Range</h2><p>For ease of transport, similarly to the standard G3, the stem can be unscrewed, collapsed, and folded down. In theory, you can then secure it to the rear with a clip. Unfortunately, this mechanism is unreliable, and I found it often didn't latch, making it very dangerous to rely on. So I had to grab the back as well, rather than lug it around one-handed from just the stem. At 40kg, you're not carrying this upstairs anyway; at best, you're going to carefully lift it (from the knees!) into the back of your truck or trailer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-keyed-lock.jpg><p>Kugoo states an 80km or 50-mile range, though, as ever, this will depend on your weight, what terrain you're riding on, and whether you're using full power. In reality, 50 miles is not going to happen at my weight, and riding over rough terrain and using dual motors constantly reduces that to a more realistic 30 miles of pushing it. Obviously, weighing less or using low-power single-motor mode will extend your range, but where's the fun in that?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=suspension-and-safety-features>Suspension and Safety Features</h2><p>You'll find both front and rear suspension via a four-armed shock absorber, and the rear suspension is a coil spring. For safety, you have front and rear oil hydraulic disk brakes XOD brand, which feel very responsive to me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-removable-battery.jpg><p>Interestingly, you'll also find turn signals (at least, either left or right side lighting will flash when activated). Not a lot of use off-road, but if you're riding this on the streets, that's a huge safety feature. In total, there are 11 lights on the G3 Pro: four headlights, four sidelights, and three rear lights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-action-shot-moors.jpg><p>As well as two smaller lights on the front and rear side of the deck, and a rear brake light, you have a larger dual LED light on the front. You can adjust the front light up or down, and it's easy to replace if needed. Which I did. This thing is so heavy that it arrived with some pretty hefty shipping damage (thanks DHL), so we had to wait for some replacement parts before filming. Still, despite all that, functionally, it was fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-action-shot-front-tyre.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In dual-motor mode, you really do have to be careful. The G3 Pro has a serious kick to it, and I'd suggest putting your foot right on the raised kickstand at the back. The throttle is very responsive, almost too responsive, and the slightest of touches will launch you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-action-shot-offroading.jpg><p>If you don't have a firm grip and you're not ready for that burst of power, it can be dangerous, and with something this powerful you really do need a full-face dirt bike helmet and consider some body armor of some kind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-rear-design-shot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=security-and-display>Security and Display</h2><p>In terms of security features, you have both a keyed lock to turn the power on, and the battery itself is removable. On the front of the deck is a rubber cover, and enclosed within a three-digit number lock, preventing the deck from being lifted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kugoo-kirin-g3-pro-riding-forest.jpg><p>Underneath that, you'll find the battery. Although removable, you do need to unscrew two screws to get it out and unplug it. The plug is quite rugged but the battery isn't nearly as easily removed as some e-bikes are. Still, it can be removed to take it inside for safekeeping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=performance-and-off-road-capability>Performance and Off-Road Capability</h2><p>The KuKirin G3 Pro can go 0-20mph in around 4 seconds at full speed, though there are three different speed settings as well as a quick button to toggle single or dual motor mode. I found dual speed mode 2 was the best overall setting for me, and only whacked it up to 3 on particularly hilly locations or very rough trails.</p><p>I took this out firstly across the rugged local Cornish moor, where you face a variety of softer grassy areas and rocky outcrops, and it was unrivaled by anything I've tried before. My wife was tagging along on an e-bike we were also testing, and it was just unable to keep up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We also took this out on some local bike trails and blazed through them. I will say it's still a fairly bumpy ride over chunky stones compared to an e-bike because the wheels are so much smaller, of course, but it still handles fine as long as you've got a good grip. The puddles were no problem; I pushed it as hard as I could in places, and it was just ridiculously good fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you do get stuck, the dual-drive motor power is so immense that you can just push through it. Hold on tight, get a good grip on the foot stand, and push the throttle; it will handle anything. The inclines were no problem; I just didn't notice them, and it was easily my fastest laps around those trails.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That said, these tires are all-terrain type, not specifically off-road. They're dual-purpose, so it was a bit slippery at times. Going with fully off-road knobbly tires would have been a better choice for how the bike is otherwise built and marketed. It's also very much illegal to ride this on the road here, though, so I may be biased.</p><h2 id=best-value-offroad-dual-motor-beast>Best Value Offroad Dual-Motor Beast</h2><p>For the price, the KuKirin G3 Pro can't be beaten on features or power, with a maximum theoretical speed of 60km/h and 80km range in ideal conditions. The sheer power in dual motor mode is unbelievable; you should wear a full-face helmet if you're heading off-road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The aggressive design also means it stands out a lot, so I wouldn't recommend riding the streets of London on this; you will get stopped by the police. For those of you who live in more modern countries where escooters aren't illegal in public, the turn signals, ample lighting, and responsive brakes are great for city riding. For particularly hilly cities, you'll definitely appreciate the extra power. Hill starts are of no concern for this beast (in fact, you better hold on tight), and the superb suspension means you can jump up and down all the curbs with ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not the most powerful scooter out there by any means. If you spend upwards of $2500, you'll find scooters even more suited to off-road, even more powerful than this.
