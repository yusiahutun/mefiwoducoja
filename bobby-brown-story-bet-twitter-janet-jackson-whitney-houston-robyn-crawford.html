The dramatization seems to reveal that Brown was involved in a relationship with Janet Jackson in the 1980s, cheated on Whitney just before he proposed, and that his current wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown, has been in the picture since the '90s.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:42934b74-f213-5e62-a038-4671e64fc721 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e0cbca33-e97a-540c-826c-b19b7896a6ac data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5c/5by4/2018/07/27/5c7f8ad95e335ae2b202588440bbc31f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bobby Brown Gets Grilled Over, Denies Whitney Houston Abuse at TCA Press Conference</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Also, <strong><a href=#>Bobby Brown</a></strong> is a singer.</p><p>Just putting that out there, because it seems to be the least interesting part of him, and certainly doesn't seem to be the part this biopic has any interest in exploring.</p><p>Instead, it's all about the more sensational and salacious parts of his life, and particularly his sex life.

Bold and trashy move, BET.</p><p>Bobby further alleges that Janet refused to go public with their relationship because he was black. The film alludes to this being a thing in the Jackson family.</p><p>The reaction on Twitter to the Janet revelations in the film were mixed, with most people expressing shock that they had no idea the two were ever a thing. Others, though, still don't think they ever were, and took it a step further, fully anticipating Ms. Jackson to file a defamation lawsuit against Brown and the network.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was today years old when I found out Bobby Brown was cracking Janet Jackson.</p><a href=# rel=noopener>@austinxwill</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Janet Jackson On The Phone With Her Lawyer Like . . . <a href=#>#BobbyBrownBET </a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N8RpfOaPOf</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@tom__boyyy</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Janet Jackson was married for a whole 10 years before she let y'all know she was getting divorced.
