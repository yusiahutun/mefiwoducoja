In the realm of philosophy and self-improvement, Aristotle's quote, "I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self," holds profound significance.

<time>24 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>身体の健康を改善するのと同じように、脳を活性化させる方法も数多くある。
「脳は長年研究されてきましたが、常に変化し、発達していることがわかったのはここ20年ほどのことです」と話すのは、登録栄養士のジョー・シャープ氏
「私たちの環境とライフスタイルは、脳の健康を形成し、トラウマと栄養の両方が非常に重要な役割を果たします」。
彼女は、脳は非常に複雑で、800億以上のニューロン（神経細胞）があり、それらの一つ一つに何千ものシナプス結合があると説明する。
「そのため、脳が成長するために必要なものを、受胎時から確保する必要があるのです」。
以下、シャープ氏をはじめとする専門家に聞いた、あなたの脳を最大限に活用するためのヒントをUK版『Harper's BAZAAR』よりご紹介。 1．新しいスキルを身につける知識やスキルは使わないと忘れてしまうものだが、脳への刺激は「認知予備能」を高めるのに役立つというのが専門家らの見解。
「身体と同じように、脳もまた、認知的・精神的な健康を保つために定期的に運動する必要があります」と話すのは、脳の健康にアプローチするプロダクト「Noon」の共同創設者兼最高科学責任者であり、神経科学者のクリスティン・ウォン氏。
「新しいことを学ぶと神経の新生が刺激され、脳内に新しいつながりが生まれます。既存のスキルを練習すると、そのつながりが強化されます」。
TV出演などで知られるイギリスの医師、ランガン・チャタジー氏のポッドキャスト「Feel Better Live More」では、ワシントン大学の神経科学教授であるトミー・ウッド氏が、晩年の認知機能低下は避けられないものではないと述べている。ウッド氏によると、幼児期の学びには神経的に大きな労力を要するが、年齢が上がるにつれて新たなインプットが少なくなると、脳の複雑性は薄れていくのだとか。「早く引退した人は、早く死ぬ傾向がある」とのことで、「脳を働かせることは、脳の健康にとって信じられないほど強力だ」と述べている。
もしやる気があれば、語学、スポーツ、ダンス、歌、編み物、コーディングなど、新しいスキルを身につけるのがウッド氏のおすすめ。
2．”ブレインフード”を多く食べる「食事は健康な脳の発達の基礎となるものです」とシャープ氏。「さらに言えば、食事は脳、認知、思考に直接影響を与えます。脳は私たちの身体のCEOであるといえます。例えば、私たちが摂取する食べ物によって、どのホルモンがどこに放出されるべきかが決まります。ミネラル、ビタミン、抗酸化物質が豊富な食品は脳に栄養を与えますが、精製された糖分を多く含む食品は、炎症を起こしたり、インスリン抵抗性を低下させることもあります」。さらに、脳は食物の多様性によって良い影響を受け、45種類もの異なる栄養素を必要とすることが研究で示されているそう。なかでも、脳の発達に重要な役割を果たすことが知られている、必須脂肪酸、抗酸化物質、植物栄養素、アミノ酸などの特定の栄養素群はよく知られたところ。
例えば、脂がのった魚、濃い葉野菜、ベリー類、エクストラバージンオリーブオイル、アボカド、亜麻仁、ヘンプ、チアシードなどの”良い脂肪”、そして豆、レンズ豆、ひよこ豆などの豆類は繊維の素晴らしい供給源となる。
「腸と脳は、腸脳軸という中枢神経系と腸管神経系の双方向のコミュニケーションによってつながっています。食物繊維は腸内細菌の餌となり、脳のはたらきをサポートします」とシャープ氏。
3．積極的に水分補給する上記の食品と同様に、水分補給が重要であるとシャープ氏。「脳の水分が1％でも失われると、気分や集中力に影響を与えることが示されています。水分補給をしっかりすることで、脳に良い影響を与えることができます。私のアドバイスは、毎朝、何よりも先に大きなグラス一杯の水で始めることです」。
「私たちの身体のほとんどは水でできており、生きるために必要なものですが、食事から摂取した栄養素を脳や身体に運ぶためにも絶対に必要なものなのです」とウォン氏。
もし、疲れやすい、頭痛がする、頭がぼーっとするといった症状があるのなら、脱水症状の可能性がある、とのこと。「水をたくさん飲むだけで、エネルギー、集中力、気分は驚くほど変わります。また、スイカやキュウリなど、水分の多い食品を摂取することでも水分補給ができます」。
4．オメガ3を摂取する「脳の60％以上は脂肪でできており、オメガ3脂肪酸はその細胞膜を構成する成分です」とシャープ氏。「脳は身体の他の部分に正しい指示を送る役割を担っており、ニューロン（脳細胞）が十分なオメガ3を持っていれば、互いにうまくコミュニケーションをとることができるのです」。
サプリメントを摂取することで、神経伝達物質に作用し、認知力、集中力にプラスの影響を与えることができるとのこと。

オメガ3は、脂の乗った魚からも摂取することができる。サーモン、サバ、イワシ、ニシン、アンチョビなどが挙げられ、理想はすべて天然ものを食べること。
「オメガ3はどれも同じというわけではありません。サプリメントを選ぶ際は、安全性や濃度をよく確認してください」。
ベジタリアンの場合、海藻類ベースのオメガ3もオプションに。
「亜麻仁、クルミ、チアなどのベジタリアン食材は、ある程度のオメガ3を含みますが、最適なレベルに達するには十分でないことが多いのです」。

5．向精神薬やアダプトゲンを検討する植物成分も脳にポジティブな影響を与えるとされ、何世紀にもわたって中国やアーユルヴェーダの伝統医学で使用されてきた。アダプトゲンとは、私たちの身体が外的ストレスに適応するのを助けてくれるハーブのこと。ナイトシェード科に属するアダプトゲンであるアシュワガンダは、記憶力を高め、認知障害と戦い、情報処理速度を向上させる効果があるとして、現在研究が進められている注目の成分。
ヤマブシタケをはじめとするキノコ類に含まれる天然の向精神薬も脳に作用し、研究によると、記憶力と集中力を高め、気分を向上させ、創造性を高めるという。

The away shirt of Italian side Fiorentina from the 1992/93 season was banned halfway through the campaign after it was discovered to include a Swastika within the design.
