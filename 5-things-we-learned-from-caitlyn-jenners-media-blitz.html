"The Democrats are better there,” she said Tuesday night. “But for me, I've been around a long time, I'm probably more conservative. I believe in little things like the Constitution and freedom. I believe in minimal government…. And so Republicans have done a better job in that direction.”</p><p>“I gotta keep an eye on these people," Jenner stressed. "Trump, who I talked to before [at] the Inauguration, about a lot of LGBT issues when the whole North Carolina bathroom bill, all that mess. And I had talked to him about my feelings on that. All of sudden he gets into office and one of the first things he does, which he never should have done, is repeal the Title IX for equality for trans people in school. That was good federal guidelines for states to be able to follow, and I blasted him."</p><p>Will she vote for him again? Too early to tell at this point.</p><p>“I was asked a question the other day, 'Would you vote for him again?'" Jenner said. "I said, 'Wait a second, it's three and a half years away. There's a lot that's going to happen in that three and a half years and I'll make that decision at that point.'”</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b6157402-8a2d-554d-b4b3-0b6d20d51dae data-container-ref=toofab:article:b0444849-889b-56e5-87ac-f5701824d568 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ac/5by4/2017/04/26/ac86f96df36755b198bcfabcc0f42514_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Why Caitlyn Jenner Kinda, Sorta, But Not Really Regrets Voting for Donald Trump</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>She Wants to Co-Host 'Live!

I've watched your show for years, I've seen you go through all this stuff -- and I've never been asked to co-host."</p><p>"Done and done," Kelly Ripa replied.</p><p>"I keep thinking, 'When am I going to get the phone call?'

"It's just the public's perception is they think that's what it's all about, and it is not about that. It is about my soul."</p><p>"And you're very clear: You said, 'I am a trans woman, I'm not a woman, I can't give birth,'" Lemon said.</p><p>"I didn't have the same experience.

Lemon asked Jenner in the same "CNN Tonight" interview. Although Jenner was turned off by Trump's decision to reverse Obama-era guidance on Title IX -- a federal law which bans sex discrimination in school, but now excludes gender identity from protection -- she wants to meet with the President to ask him why he made that decision.</p><p>"He wants me to play golf with him,” Jenner said. “I would love to, even after the fact that he took this Title IX thing away, I would love to go down to play golf with him and say, 'Why the hell did you do that? That was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.' And tell him that, but now I can't. If I was publicly seen with him, my community would go nuts. I would be ostracized from the community, so I'd like to have that meeting, but I'd have it privately and nobody would ever know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21ma25fanq1tMinnqxlp5p6rbHAq6WenF2bv7C5jJyYoqycrrtutsSnpZ6qo2K6prDImmSbpJmpx3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-things-we-learned-from-caitlyn-jenners-media-blitz.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./guess-the-luke-bryan-song.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./guess-the-luke-bryan-song.html>Can You Guess the Luke Bryan Song?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brendan-schaub-conor-mcgregor-penis-pic.html>UFC's Brendan Schaub Betting His Penis on Conor McGregor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brendan-schaub-conor-mcgregor-penis-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
