The kayak’s cockpit does not allow much movement and my legs have become numb from inactivity. My lower back is sore, my shoulders are cramping up and my elbows creak with pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is with much relief that I complete the 15km crossing from Phuket to Koh Panak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With towering peaks, lush green jungle and sheer limestone walls honeycombed with stalactites and sea caves, Koh Panak is a popular stopover for day cruises that carry dozens of sit-on-top kayaks for their guests to spend a few hours paddling around the bay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The last of these boats are heading back to Phuket when I make landfall at a small beach on Koh Panak’s east coast and set up camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/08fcdb2b-2da9-4b73-8cb2-abcacd66c2dc_8157512d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I heat a can of tomato soup and follow it with a cupcake with a small candle and wish myself a happy birthday before falling asleep to the sound of baby waves lapping on the beach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I awake the sun is rising over the bay, painting the sky crimson and the water with a golden glaze. Crabs scamper up the beach while a pair of pterodactyl-like hornbills explode from a tree, making loud “gok” and “rroh” sounds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tiny footprints in the sand around my tent lead to a grey-haired macaque trying to rip open a packet of instant noodles pinched from my kayak overnight. The monkey drops the packet as I approach and scampers onto a big rock from where he watches patiently for another lapse in my defences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/9625c6da-86e8-431f-994e-fea26296403c_8dc80c71.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Koh Panak I head north, rock-hopping between the most dramatic and iconic karst formations of Phang Nga Bay: Koh Hong, which has a hidden lagoon that can be accessed by kayak through two narrow openings; and James Bond Island, where parts of the 1974 spy thriller The Man with the Golden Gun were filmed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the movie, the island was the secret lair of villain Francisco Scaramanga and select guests such as Bond. Now it’s a tourist trap and anyone can come, with dozens of boats jockeying for space on the beach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I arrive, at least 1,000 tourists are snapping selfies and strolling down a wooden boardwalk lined with hawker stalls selling trinkets and snacks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I head instead to a nearby island that is as drop-dead gorgeous but without a person in sight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/d68c6ea5-1dd4-451c-bdb8-39c5a9f5ea0f_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After lunch, I continue north through a channel between two islets where a few stationary flat-bottom boats with tables and chairs serve as bases for kayakers on day tours from Phuket.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As I pass the most northerly platform, two men – one old, one young – invite me aboard and, after hearing about my journey, offer to let me stay the night. The offer seems heaven-sent; the pain in my elbows, which are now red, has been building up all afternoon. Every stroke of the paddle hurts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They give me ice to reduce the swelling and a sliver of soap, a raggedy old towel and a bucket of fresh water to shower with. After only two days at sea, these simple items seem like luxuries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The following morning I paddle north for two hours to Koh Panyee, an inhabited island that sits on a river mouth on the north coast of Phang Nga Bay. It is covered with stilt houses and has a large, onion-domed mosque and a floating mini-soccer pitch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the boardwalk, men openly smoke and sell marijuana, which was recently decriminalised in Thailand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/cc6a8fde-7678-4f4b-bdda-b93e133d207b_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Koh Panyee, I head east along a thick mangrove forest on the north coast of the bay, where monitor lizards, some more than a metre long, belly-flop into the water, apparently just for kicks. But when I get closer, I see one surface with a fish clamped between its jaws.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the early afternoon, I pass a fishing village on a riverbank and moor my kayak at a waterfront restaurant. It’s my first real meal in three days and I eat like a pig: a whole fried chicken, papaya salad with prawns, sticky rice and vegetables, followed by banana pancakes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I had planned to paddle only a few more hundred metres upriver to a guest house and call it a day. But it is now low tide and large sections of the river are impenetrable mudflats. My map shows that there’s an alternative route – a 3km loop around a headland that leads to a back channel that connects with the same river.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The journey, I calculate, should take about an hour. But I fail to take into account the vast sandbank hidden by a few centimetres of water that surrounds the headland at low tide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/351725d1-dd12-46f1-bb72-0bdbe138fdad_d40e4bb7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within half an hour of setting off, I get stuck. Trying to reverse course is pointless; there’s nothing to do but wait. Three hours pass until I am released by the tide. And that back channel I saw on the map? Well, it is blocked by mangroves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I have no choice but to paddle back to my starting point, by which time the water has risen and I can paddle right up to the guest house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the time I arrive there, I am so tired I can barely raise my arms and my knees are sunburned red. I could’ve just waited at the restaurant in comfort all afternoon, read my novel, watched the sunset and paddled here in a matter of minutes. But that would’ve required patience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/df27be02-cbdb-4548-9c89-3683a61e1302_19a8b845.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After five days at sea, my body has become accustomed to six to eight hours of daily exercise and the aches and pains have faded. But while paddling past the mist-covered mountains on the bay’s west coast on Day 7, I get stomach cramps from overexerting my abs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the first time on this journey, I feel I cannot go on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I fish my phone out of my dry bag and search for the closest guest house or campsite. But the only accommodation nearby is the Banyan Tree Krabi resort, which charges 10 times as much as your average guest house in Thailand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To hell with it, I think, you only live once. I book a room online and annotate it with a message that I will arrive in a kayak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ten minutes later I land on the beachfront of the resort. I am greeted by three men who carry my kayak past the high-tide line that by itself justifies the steep room rate: I cannot even bend over, such is the pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve had some come in yachts before,” one of them tells me. “But never in a kayak.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/830e4723-ad4f-49d3-84dd-bcf483608ddb_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a good night’s sleep and a long hot shower, I walk to the hotel restaurant and attack the breakfast buffet. Then I go back for seconds and thirds – calories I will no doubt need for the longest day of the trip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On most days, I cover 15km to 20km. But today I must travel 25km, with a stop at Koh Kai – Chicken Island – for lunch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sun is shining brightly and I am feeling strong as I leave Chicken Island for a campsite 14km away. But suddenly the sky turns a dark shade of grey, the sea becomes angry and it begins to rain so hard I can barely see a few metres in any direction.</p>With the tide working against me, I must paddle twice as hard and my stomach cramps return with a vengeanceIan Neubauer<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I lose all sense of where I am and begin to feel fear. Then, as though on cue, a marine horn blasts through the air. I turn around to see the faint outline of a covered boat and two figures motioning for me to come aboard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They are a married couple from Krabi town, in the north, returning home after a spot of fishing. They don’t speak English and I only know a little Thai, but they understand that I’m paddling east, towards the coast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After securing my kayak with a rope they alter course, slashing hours off my journey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the rain stops, about an hour later, I thank my new friends and get back to work. I’m still 5km from the coast and with an average paddling speed of 3km/h, there is just enough time to get there before dark. But with the tide working against me, I must paddle twice as hard and my stomach cramps return with a vengeance.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why airfares are sky high after the pandemic, and set to stay that way</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet this time, there’s no other option but to fight through the pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I finally reach the beach a new problem presents itself. The tide is fully out and there are some 300 metres of soft sand between me and the campsite.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The kayak is too heavy to drag so I unload my gear and carry it up to the high-tide mark in three separate trips before returning for the kayak. I’m beyond exhausted when the job is complete and collapse on the grass. Within moments I am sleeping.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On what is supposed to be the last night of my journey I stay in a bungalow on Koh Yao Noi, one of two mountainous islands in the geographic heart of Phang Nga Bay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/38ea8f8c-dd7e-424b-85d4-225035f2a918_ddaf49e4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the evening a big storm sets in and the rain rattles against the windows until dawn. By midmorning the weather has calmed, though the bay remains choppy and pockmarked with white-capped waves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I take in a lot of water as I head south along the west coast of Koh Yao Noi and spend as much time bailing as I do paddling. But when I enter the channel beside sister island Koh Yao Yai, the water turns as still as a lake.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Edged on either side by fine white beaches and leaning palm trees, the channel demands to be photographed. But as I retrieve my phone, I notice I had not properly sealed my dry bag and saltwater has seeped inside.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My phone is ruined – and I’ve lost all the photos from this trip except for a handful I uploaded to social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/05/07b02633-3007-43bc-84a0-5fdac28da735_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I want to stamp around and curse and feel sorry for myself but do not have the time.
