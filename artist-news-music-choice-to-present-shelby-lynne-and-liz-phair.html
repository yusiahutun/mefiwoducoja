(AP) — Stone Temple Pilots lead singer Scott Weiland was ordered to return to a live-in drug detoxification center after leaving early, officials said.</p><p>Weiland, 36 was ordered to report to the facility last October after pleading no contest to possession of heroin. A Superior Court judge learned Friday that he had walked out or was discharged after only a month and ordered him to return, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.</p><p>Weiland reported back to the facility Friday afternoon. He is eligible for release in July but must participate in a six-month follow-up program.</p><p>If he leaves the center again or tests positive for drugs, prosecutors will seek a warrant for his arrest, Robison said.</p><p>Weiland was jailed in 1999 for violating probation on a previous drug arrest and failing to complete a rehabilitation program.</p><p>In a separate case, attorneys for Weiland entered an innocent plea for the singer's misdemeanor count of driving under the influence, stemming from his arrest last October in Hollywood.</p><p>He is due back in court on that case on Feb. 5.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/newsbulletic.gif border=0 align=center style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><b>Singer Adams Pregnant With Second Child</b></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/yadams290104.gif align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>NEW YORK (AP) — Yolanda Adams is two months pregnant with her second child, but the gospel singer isn't slowing down.</p><p>Already the mother of a 3-year-old daughter, Adams is still on tour, she recently co-hosted gospel music's 19th Annual Stellar Awards and she'll participate in the Super Bowl Gospel Celebration, which takes place two days before the Feb. 1 Super Bowl.</p><p>The 41-year-old says she's used to keeping up a heavy pace: "I toured up until the eight and a half months (last time)."</p><p>Adams is a big football fan, and the game is being held in Houston, where she lives. But while she's gearing up for the pomp and circumstance surrounding the big event, she's not as excited about the actual game this time around, with the New England Patriots-Carolina Panthers matchup: "None of the teams that I thought would be in it are in it. I was hoping that the (Tennessee) Titans would have been in it."</p><p>She was more enthusiastic about the Stellar Awards, which also took place in Houston earlier this month. Among those present for the awards, which will broadcast in syndicated television markets starting Saturday, included gospel stars Shirley Ceasar, Kirk Franklin and Donnie McClurkin, as well as R&B stars such as Musiq, Ruben Studdard and Patti LaBelle.</p><p>Adams says the participation of secular stars shows how widespread an influence gospel music has.</p><p>"It is extremely important for the general public to realize that these people came from the church, came from choirs, came from a diverse background that includes gospel music," she says.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/newsbulletic.gif border=0 align=center style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><b>Jerry Lewis Home After Rehab Stint</b></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/LASVEGASjerryl.jpg align=left style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Comedian Jerry Lewis has returned home from a rehabilitation center several weeks early, after overcoming a steroid dependence and shedding more than 50 pounds, his publicist said Tuesday.</p><p>"He looks fabulous. His face is back to being the regular Jerry Lewis," said Candi Cazau, spokeswoman for Lewis and The Orleans hotel-casino in Las Vegas. "When you see the before and after pictures, it's incredible."</p><p>Lewis, who turns 78 in March, was focusing on a strict diet and exercise program and was planning a March 3 performance at The Orleans, Cazau said.</p><p>Lewis signed a 20-year contract with the off-Strip hotel-casino shortly before being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.

The photo shoot preceded a luncheon organized by the National Endowment for the Arts for past and present recipients of its Jazz Masters Awards.</p><p>There were many embraces and shared reminiscences among musicians whose touring schedules often keep them apart.</p><p>"It's a very happy, warm feeling because we lose people every year," said the 85-year-old Jones, who had a chance to greet fellow pianists Dave Brubeck, Cecil Taylor, Horace Silver, Randy Weston and Billy Taylor. "It's good to see all the people you've known for years and don't get a chance to see every year."</p><p>The photo shoot had special meaning for Jones, Silver and saxophonist Benny Golson, who were also in Art Kane's historic 1958 "A Great Day in Harlem" photo that included many departed jazz legends, including Count Basie, Thelonious Monk and Charles Mingus.</p><p>For Jones, the contrast between the two photo shoots is a welcome sign of the greater respect now being shown to jazz artists.</p><p>"I think there's a lot more awareness and recognition of the accomplishments of the so-called jazz masters … than there was back in those days," said Jones.</p><p>That's what the NEA's new Chairman Dana Gioia had in mind when he expanded the Jazz Masters program, established in 1982, this year by establishing six award categories, boosting the cash award for each recipient to $25,000, and sponsoring a 50-state Jazz Masters concert tour that begins in April featuring a variety of artists.</p><p>This year's winners were singer Nancy Wilson, guitarist Jim Hall, pianist Herbie Hancock, drummer Chico Hamilton, writer Nat Hentoff and the late arranger-composer Luther Henderson.</p><p>"Jazz is one of the greatest American art forms … but it's become marginalized in our culture," said Gioia. "We're really here to celebrate jazz not as an art of the past but as one of the dynamic art forms of the present."</p><p>The luncheon preceded an evening awards ceremony and concert organized as part of the International Association for Jazz Education annual conference.</p><p><a href=#>www.arts.gov</a></p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiZoqm2tMCMp5ywq12iwrS1wmaaoaeZmLJuwM5mp6udo5q7tXnSoZylmqliubq6zZ5kmqaUYrmqxoypn5qhomQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fartist-news-music-choice-to-present-shelby-lynne-and-liz-phair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cancer-survivor-dan-bongino-recent-surgery-illness-and-health-update.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cancer-survivor-dan-bongino-recent-surgery-illness-and-health-update.html>Cancer Survivor: Dan Bongino Recent Surgery- Illness And Health Update</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./11-facts-about-drummers.html>11 Facts About Drummers - Facts.net</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./11-facts-about-drummers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
