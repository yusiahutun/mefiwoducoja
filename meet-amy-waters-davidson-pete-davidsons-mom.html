However, one can’t talk about his life without mentioning his mother and close friend, Amy Waters Davidson.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sonmom.jpg><p>Here’s what we know about her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Pete_Davidsons_Mom_Amy_Waters_Davidson></span>Who Is Pete Davidson’s Mom, Amy Waters Davidson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amy Waters Davidson is the proud mother of Pete Davidson.&nbsp;The doting mother worked as a school nurse at Xaverian High School in Brooklyn but is usually seen with her son. She has even made a few appearances on SNL.</p><p>However, despite her link to such a famous person, Amy is known to stay out of the spotlight. When she posts on social media, it is often about her children.&nbsp;On March 4, 2022, Amy melted hearts when she took to social media to honor her son on National Son’s Day.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote on Instagram: “Happy National Son’s Day! I couldn’t be more proud of the man you are today! Love you more.”&nbsp;Amy has repeatedly proven that she is her son’s biggest supporter and is proud of his work.</p><p>Another proof of Amy’s love for her son is how religiously she keeps up with the happenings in his life. While he was dating Kim Kardashian, Amy was seen encouraging the ship online.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan once declared Kim would get pregnant by Pete, and Amy’s reply had been a “Yayyy.” It clarified how invested she is in her son’s love life, but what about her own?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/l-intro-1652283043-fotor-2023080414323-1024x578.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Amy_Waters_Davidsons_Husband></span>What Happened to Amy Waters Davidson’s Husband?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amy was married to Pete’s father, Scott Davidson, until 9/11. Scott was a firefighter who died during the 9/11 tragedy, and his death <a href=#>shook</a> the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Scott attended the College of Staten Island, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history. He was very athletic and was known to play on the basketball team in college.&nbsp;</p><p>He even became captain during his senior year. Despite studying history, Scott became a firefighter on January 16, 1994, and that’s what he did until his demise.&nbsp;Scott reportedly died at 33 while running up the Marriott World Trade Centre hotel stairs on 9/11.</p><p>It was mere minutes before the second Twin Towers collapsed, and his son was only seven then.&nbsp;Amy keeps his memories alive in several ways, especially remembering him on special days like Father’s Day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Amy_Waters_Davidsons_Husbands_Death_Affect_Their_Son></span>How Did Amy Waters Davidson’s Husband’s Death Affect Their Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pete was very close to his father before he died. The comedian, whose sense of humor now helps him sell out venues, has his father to thank because he reportedly got it from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/peteee-fotor-20230804143236.jpg><p>Scott’s death shook his kids hard, but Amy did all she could to be there for them, even as she mourned. Amy was so supportive of her kids that she even let Pete start stand-up comedy at age 16 because of how sad he was growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Pete could lean into the relief comedy brought him, but moving past his father’s demise was not easy. Amy believes that her son is just now healing and truly living life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Amy_Waters_Davidson_Children></span>Amy Waters Davidson Children&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The proud mother has two kids, including Pete Davidson and a daughter named Casey.&nbsp;Casey is currently in her 20s and graduated in 2019 from Marist College. She adores her older brother and fondly posts Pete pictures on her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p>She also shares images of herself and her family, including old photos of her and her late dad. Casey did not get to spend as many years with her father as <a href=#>Pete</a>, but she also carried him in her heart.&nbsp;Theirs is not a big family, but Scott Davidson will never be forgotten as long as they’re around.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aYprFdrK61sdGsZJ2Zpp6xtLvNZqeerJVisaLCyJ2qqKajYrqwuY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-amy-waters-davidson-pete-davidsons-mom.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./funniest-instagram-meme-accounts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./funniest-instagram-meme-accounts.html>11 Funny Instagram Accounts to Follow Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-gigi-hadid-were-together-all-night-at-party.html>Leonardo DiCaprio, Gigi Hadid Were 'Together All Night' at Party</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-gigi-hadid-were-together-all-night-at-party.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
