No wonder, she was a fan favorite on TLC’s </span><i><span>Darcey & Stacey</span></i><span> season 3. This daughter of Darcey Silva was all about family, love, and self-appreciation.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading to learn more about her net worth, boyfriend, and height.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Aniko Bollok, Darcey Silva’s Daughter</b></h3><p><span>Aniko Bollok isn’t just Darcey Silva’s daughter. She is her best friend, TikTok partner, and most of all her defender.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Back in a May 2020 TikTok video, Darcey was scrutinized by fans for being a “bad example to her daughters.” And there arrived Aniko in the comments saying her mother never convinces them to get plastic surgery and that she posts their videos because she’s proud.</span></p><p><span>But Aniko’s not the only one, even her sister <a href=#>Aspen Bollok</a> often jumps into the online battlefield with her.</span></p><p><span>Her younger sister, Aspen (born: May 14, 2006) is a talented IG star with over 59K followers. Also, she excelled academically and played amazing sax. The last we saw her she made the honor roll in seventh grade at </span><i><span>Woodrow Wilson Middle School</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Aniko, her sister was a “menace with ADHD and slight anger issues” but she still loved her.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Aniko and her family were tight. They often starred over the other’s TikTok and keep fans wanting for another. To name Aniko’s most popular TikTok would be the video where she faults how she was raised by Darcey. It had almost 2 million videos.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, Aniko resided in Wethersfield, Connecticut, not very far from her hometown Manhattan, New York. Previously,&nbsp; Aniko has also resided in New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Middletown, Connecticut.</span></p><h3><b>Aniko Bollok Dad</b></h3><p><span>Aniko Bollok’s dad is the co-owner of</span><i><span> The Twilight Lodge</span></i><span>, <a href=#>Frank Bollok</a>. Also, back in the day, he used to go by the moniker “Ruse” and considered a career in the rap industry.</span></p><p><span>Her father, Frank, and Darcey were married as early as October 2006 when Darcey lost her grandmother Doris Ann Silva. Unfortunately, they could make it to a decade of anniversary and separated their ways.</span></p><p><span>Darcey then went on to get engaged to a Bulgarian man named Georgi Rusev in 2020. But again, their relationship soon suffered a rift and the two called it quits over the phone.</span></p><p><span>As for Frank, he went on to marry Kristell Mapelli in Dec 2018. The couple welcomed their first child name Ferike on October 25, 2020.</span></p><p><span>Guess, Aniko has a step-sibling now.</span></p><p><span>Despite their parents’ divorce, Aniko still has a good relationship with her dad. Also, he made it into a few of her TikToks and she seemed very appreciative of him.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Frank was proud of his daughters too, and he wasn’t hesitant to show it. For instance, on June 8, 2017, Frank took it to his FB to flaunt all of Aniko’s certificates and trophies, captioned, “She just does it cuz she supposed to #trophies #scholarathlete #proudpapa.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Aniko Bollok Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Aniko Bollok garnered a net worth of under $150 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>Aside from being a reality star, Aniko then worked at a contemporary women’s fashion line based in Los Angeles called </span><i><span>House of Eleven</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, she went to </span><i><span>Wethersfield High School</span></i><span> followed by </span><i><span>Middletown High School,</span></i><span> and later joined </span><i><span>The University of Arizona</span></i><span> for her bachelor’s degree. She was set to graduate in 2026.</span></p><p><span>Back during her high school days, Aniko was a Track And Field athlete who competed in relays, hurdles, and long jumps.</span></p><p><span>Also, in June 2021, she went on to compete in the “Miss Connecticut Teen USA” pageant and won the title “Miss Photogenic.”</span></p><p><span>This star even earned a few bucks alongside her sister over Cameo @</span><a href=#><span>aniko_and_aspen</span></a><span>, taking requests for around $3 each.</span></p><h3><b>Aniko Bollok Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Aniko Bollok mentioned that she was “newly single” in April 2021. Since then, as to the day to the day of writing this article, she’s never mentioned her old boyfriend or her new one.</span></p><p><span>However, Aniko did often thrash her old one (keeping him anonymous over) her TikTok. To summarize, she’s mentioned that her ex-boyfriend has “played her,” and made her lose confidence.</span></p><p><span>But, it was a lesson learned. Aniko shared that she now puts herself first, and is happy with the person she’s become.</span></p><p><span>Stepping back to the dating game, Aniko was waiting for “a cute boy (she’d) meet down the shore” to do different TikTok trends with. Or, she’d be happy with Cam Holmes from </span><i><span>Too Hot to Handle</span></i><span> 2021, if he’s interested.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span>Aniko shared that she had her first kiss with a year older boy who’s probably her ex-boyfriend, and Darcey wasn’t happy about it. The </span><i><span>90 Day Fiancé</span></i><span> alum wants her daughters, not to date older guys and have a meaningful first kiss.</span></p><h3><b>Aniko Bollok Height</b></h3><p><span>Aniko Bollok stands tall at a height of around 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her district features include — blond hair and a voluptuous body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Aniko Bollok?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Aniko was born on Dec 25, 2004.
