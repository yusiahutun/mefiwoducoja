After telling Cook all he had to do was "go in front of Lorne Michaels," the star said he prepped an impersonation of <a href=#>Christian Slater</a> and headed down to the "SNL" studio.</p><p>"Well, I had a huge, huge breakdown outside of Rockefeller Plaza," Cook recalled. "And I sat on a bench. I couldn't breathe. I've only had in my life, fortunately, a few really bad, catatonic state-level panic attacks -- incapacitated -- and this was just about there sitting on that bench."</p><p>Cook said he then realized he couldn't go through with the audition. His reasoning was that the show had basically told him he was a shoe-in and he began to stress about the "politics of working there."</p><p>"I had a couple of friends that were on the show, so I knew it could be cutthroat," he explained. "I was not a confrontational person. I was not a person who could fight for my opinion. I was really scared a lot. And I was like, 'I'm not ready for that. I can't do that. I can't fight.' And I called my manager and said, 'I'm not going in.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dff5b439-eba9-5140-a1cb-fb5ab008f163 data-container-ref=toofab:article:550198a5-22be-4694-84e4-5916ddf51d1a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2019/11/30/eddfab3fd1f85b0fbdae225df54e7902_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Louis C.K.

"So there was a little part of me that was happy that [Fallon] seemed happy and he’s great, but also a little part of me, that's like, 'Ooh, I don't have to do that. He can do it.'"</p><p>As for any regrets, Cook said there "none whatsoever." He even made peace with it when he came back to host the show in 2005.<strong> </strong>"I went outside before and I sat on that same bench that I cried at and felt like I failed and told myself, no, that was the beginning of your success right in that moment," he detailed.</p><p>Cook later dished on how he came to end his beef with <a href=#>Louis C.K.</a>, after the pair had been feuding for years over Cook allegedly stealing some of Louis C.K.'s joke premises. Cook has repeatedly defended himself, saying he has never stolen a joke. The pair eventually broadcast a version of their truce on Louis C.K's TV show "Louis."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4c32e398-5105-578e-ba43-933bae6eaf45 data-container-ref=toofab:article:550198a5-22be-4694-84e4-5916ddf51d1a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/90/5by4/2018/12/31/90f6523e32cf5b099a2c2bb394ff8388_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Twitter Disgusted by Louis C.K.

And so when he called me up and said, 'Hey, do you want to put this to bed in an episode of the show?' I was like, 'Oh my goodness, yes.'"</p><p>"It’s just like I'm moving on and we're all ready to talk about something else," Cook continued. "But there was, I guess, an infatuation with the internet at that time of people battling each other, or having a difference of opinion. But it had grown into this thing where we wanted to take back the story. I think that for what it was, it was one of the most compelling moments in television I think in several years. It was pretty wild."</p><p>"It was good to finally do that. I'm very proud of it and glad that we did it, but it was nice to move away from that."</p><p>Despite the relationship being repaired, the feud was brought up again when accusations of Louis C.K.'s sexual misconduct were<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> brought to light in 2017</a>.</p><p>"I just remember feeling like there's nothing good coming out of this moment right now," Cook recalled, "For me, maybe at that point in my life I'd had enough therapy that it was like, that's not my experience to understand first-hand, because I wasn't there on either side of it."</p><p>"I think that people expected [me to have a reaction], because I had a moment with Louis, but it's not comparable to whatever else that was. That has nothing to do with two comics arguing over a bit. So, how I felt about it was, I didn't really feel anything either way for it. It didn't make me feel very good in any regard."</p><a id=gallery-link-14fdbe19-faf3-5490-ab33-182ab923966a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:14fdbe19-faf3-5490-ab33-182ab923966a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:550198a5-22be-4694-84e4-5916ddf51d1a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/13/4by3/2018/02/22/13121f7445a153d38fe616cdfc128881_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGlmaW9fma6vsYycpqijXaeyt7HApapmr5iueqmxjK2sq6aVmXqlu9anZKymnGLBorjKrGSlp6WewG6vjKRm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdane-cook-reveals-why-he-turned-down-snl-talks-louis-c-k.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harry-potter-and-the-magic-of-social-media.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harry-potter-and-the-magic-of-social-media.html>Harry Potter and the Magic of Social Media</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./441472-valentines-day-questions-partner.html>50+ Best Valentine's Day questions to ask your partner in 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./441472-valentines-day-questions-partner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
