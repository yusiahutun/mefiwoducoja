Some believe the small flowers actually formed from Eve's tears as she left the Garden of Eden, and the flower is mentioned several times in the Bible (see below for more).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">It's often seen at royal weddings, and not just in England.

In the Victorian era, it symbolized a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://extension.psu.edu/programs/master-gardener/counties/luzerne/news/2021/may-birth-flower-lily-of-the-valley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="return to happiness" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">return to happiness</a>. In ancient times it was associated with humility and purity, as well as the goddess Ostara (from whose name we get our modern Easter). It's also been <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.galimard.com/en/blog/lily-of-the-valley-the-symbol-of-the-month-of-may data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="associated with the Greek god Apollo" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">associated with the Greek god Apollo</a>, who is said to have created it so his nymphs would have a soft carpet to walk on. In contemporary times it is associated with motherhood and happiness, but most formally with spring, especially May.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">What birth month are lilies of the valley for?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Being the official flower of May, lily of the valley is also known as May lily, or May bells.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">What kind of plant is lily of the valley?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lily of the valley's scientific name is Convallaria majalis. It's a cool-weather woodland plant, native to Europe and northern parts of Asia, and is related to asparagus — though it is most definitely not edible. Being a perennial plant, it can last for years in woods or gardens where it becomes established, but it does not tolerate heat well and will often die if the weather is warm too long.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lily of the valley blooms in low-growing bunches (about 6 to 12 inches high) and the blooms last for just 3 to 4 weeks in the late spring. Though native to Europe, it is considered an invasive species in North America.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">What does the Bible say about lily of the valley flowers?<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">When the Bible refers to lilies, it's not talking specifically about Convallaria majalis. In fact, it's possible that the Bible is not even referring to more <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/gardening/g32149452/lilies-types/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="traditional types of lillies" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">traditional types of lillies</a>. Because flower names have changed so much over the years, and because different translations often compound confusion, it's difficult, if not impossible to know for certain which specific flowers are being referred to, and at one point "lily" was a name that simply meant a showy flower.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Convallaria majalis, in fact, was named lily of the valley at some point in the 16th or 17th century as a reference to Song of Solomon 2:1-2, which reads "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. / As a lily among brambles, so is my love among the young women." But that's not the only time the word lily appears in the Bible.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Matthew 6:28 has, perhaps, the most famous reference to lilies. It reads: "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow / they toil not, neither do they spin." That same phrase, "lilies of the field" appears in Luke 12:27. The Songs of Solomon have a number of references to lilies. In 5:13 it reads: "His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, / Banks of sweet-scented herbs; / His lips are lilies / Dripping with liquid myrrh." In 4:5 it reads "Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies." and in 7:2: "Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies."</p><img alt="lily of the valley" title="Lily of the Valley" width=2122 height=1416 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lily-of-the-valley-royalty-free-image-1663267530.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Westend61</span><span class="css-7spg7x e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Are lilies of the valley poisonous?<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Despite their reputation for both beauty and happiness, these are plants that would most definitely make you unhappy if you eat them. The plant contains a group of chemicals, called "glycosides" that affect the heart, making them dangerously poisonous to both people and pets. Children and small animals especially should stay away from the plant, especially its berries. Though they're safe to handle — not causing skin irritation — it's recommended that you wash hands throughly after touching them before eating or drinking anything.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">What to know before planting lily of the valley flowers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">As they originally grew on forest floors, lily of the valley plants love shade and will do well under trees or anywhere that doesn't get full sun. Once established they spread readily underground, through rhizomes, and in fact can be invasive. If you're worried about spread, consider growing them in pots or other containers, where they'll flourish without spreading. They like acidic to neutral soil and will do best in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hardiness zones" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">hardiness zones</a> 3-7.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If growing them in the ground, be sure to dig up and divide the roots every few years. This will spark new growth and ensure plants continue to flower. Once established, lily of the valley make great ground cover and need very little in the way of care, as they don't suffer much from disease and don't need to be watered except in cases of drought.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4ee90ba8-a422-457b-8971-34d2096febf7_1623953979.jpg alt="Headshot of Christopher Michel" title="Headshot of Christopher Michel" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Chris is the Senior Food & Garden Editor at Country Living, where he covers all things edible or growable.
