Some of the Blossoms of the Savannah themes as depicted in the novel include:</p><h3>1. Gender inequality</h3><p class=align-left>Gender inequality is one of the major themes in almost all aspects of Taiyo and Resian's lives. Like many other parts of the country, women in Nasila are treated as subordinate to their male counterparts. As a result, they are denied the freedom to make decisions about their lives.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, women are expected to be monogamous, while men are polygamous. Furthermore, women have no choice over who to marry. Lastly, Taiyo and Resian are seen as law violators upon resisting FGM and wanting to further their education.</p><h3>2. Corruption</h3><p class=align-left>Oloisudori is one of the main characters embodying the theme of corruption. He offers government contracts to people before using them as leverage against his <a href=#>business</a> partner. Despite everyone knowing how corrupt he is, nothing is done to stop him because his practice has been normalized.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cbc94e96b243c11.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is ‘Girl in the Closet’ on Lifetime based on a true story?</span></p></a><h3>3. Courage</h3><p class=align-left>Kaelo's daughter displays courage in facing all the tragic incidences they face. They courageously escape their aggressors, including family, are self-defensive against attempted rape and speak out against unjust<a href=#> cultural practices</a>. Minik also fearlessly takes in girls running away from arranged marriages and FGM.</p><h3>4. Coming of Age</h3><p class=align-left>The novel explores the coming-of-age theme by outlining the nature of adolescence and how complex it is to become an adult in the Maa community. The people of Nasila are seen exerting much pressure on Resian and Taiyo's parents to circumcise the girls as a rite of passage to alleged womanhood.</p><h3>5. Family Ties</h3><p class=align-left>The book brings out the strong family ties, the foundation of the Maa society and culture. Each character is seen as a daughter, son, father, or mother rather than an individual self. Therefore, their identities are pegged on their roles in the family unit. Leaving home means breaking societal and family ties.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ab46b0bded6091c9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Betrayal in the City summary, themes, analysis, study guide</span></p></a><h3>6. Duties</h3><p class=align-left>All characters in the novel have a set of obligations they are expected to fulfil. For instance, Mama Milanoi must respect and support her husband's decisions. Ole Kaelo must provide for his family and prepare his children for marriage. The daughters must obey and follow authority.</p><p class=align-left>Blossoms of the Savannah summary and analysis is a good read for book enthusiasts or anyone who enjoys a good and insightful story. As a Kenyan, readers will notice that the novel captures almost everything they have experienced. It reminds the readers about the conflicting co-existence of modern and traditional cultures.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about <a href=#>Father of Nations.</a> This is a satirical novel set in Africa and published in 2013. Through the novel, the talented author brings to date all the things that have gone amiss in Africa.
