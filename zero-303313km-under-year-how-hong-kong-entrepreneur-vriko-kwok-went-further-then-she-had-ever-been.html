<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, when sportswear brand Lululemon invited her to take part in Further, the 32-year-old decided to not let bullying define her relationship with running and instead chose to take “a leap of faith”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The gamble paid off and Kwok went from zero to 303.313 kilometres in less than a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/16/55da4f64-b386-46b9-a87b-c1f30c452ad6_bf3830c0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taking place in Lake Cahuilla, California, in March, the Further event supported 10 female athletes from around the world to run their farthest distance over six days. A research team from the Canadian Sport Institute also collected data during the event to be published at the end of the year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Collectively, the women ran 4636.327 kilometres, with US ultrarunner Camille Herron setting 13 records, including the women’s six-day world record at 901.764km.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwok was the only athlete with no previous running experience at the start line of the 4.12-kilometre looped course. She was joined by Chinese ultra runner Xiaomeng Jia and Korean judo black belt Yoon Young Kang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rest of the team featured Australian Montana Farrah-Seaton and Americans Stefanie Flippin, Kayla Jeter, Mirna Valerio, Devon Yanko and Leah Yingling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The women were supported through a year-long training programme with access to coaches, sports scientists and nutritionists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Completing the challenge among world-class athletes meant Kwok was able to gain valuable experience from her teammates. They advised her to concentrate on training to time rather than distance, and to be comfortable with walking rather than feeling pressured to run a whole session.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her training began 11 months before the challenge and built up progressively via a mixture of running, aerial yoga and strength training.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In March last year she was running 55 kilometres a month, but by January 2024 this had increased to 500 kilometres. This equated to 25 to 30 hours of training a week – which meant getting up at 4am and fitting in three strength sessions per week during lunch time and evenings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Living in Yuen Long, she spent much of her time running nearby in Tai Tong Country Park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/16/1668fbe5-71aa-400a-97fe-98ccb5a5c5d4_f41959ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although she initially continued with jiu jitsu, when her opponent pulled out of a major tournament in May 2023, Kwok took this as “a sign to fully focus on running”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the intense running programme and a pre-existing knee problem from the martial art, Kwok did not pick up any injuries. She believes this was because she listened to her body and reduced training when she had any niggles or excess fatigue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And although she lost nine kilograms during training, when it came to the Further challenge she knew calories were vital. She had to consume up to 4,000 calories a day to stay energised, and this involved regularly eating gels, rice, noodles and energy drinks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every morning without fail, I had avocado with poached eggs and two slices of bacon – which I hadn’t eaten for 25 years. But one of my teammates said the sodium and fat were really good for ultra running.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the six-day event, Kwok would get up at 4am to start running laps before having a nap in the afternoon when temperatures rose. Then she would start running again until around 10pm with the aim of completing 50 kilometres a day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lululemon tested pioneering bespoke kit during the challenge, with 36 innovations specifically designed for women. These included everything from footwear to cooling vests, ice sleeves, sports bras and running onesies. Despite covering more than 300km in six days, Kwok did not pick up a single blister or injury.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She even started her period unexpectedly on the first day. “I did have the option to take a pill and stop the period but I did not. I just went with it because it is part of being a woman. But it was hard because the course had no coverage and there was no shade. It was completely exposed and very hot and dry. Then at night it was cold and very windy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Running laps was not only physically challenging but also a huge mental test.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you are running in a loop, it gets very lonely. I did not listen to anything because I was already under a lot of stress and I find that adds to the stress. But from day two we started running some laps together for company even though we were at different speeds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/16/aa87929f-6e58-40aa-88dc-b1cd91ca4089_c49010dd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Kwok said finishing was “the highest of highs”, she soon hit the post-race blues. “Exhaustion lingers in the body and I have been sleeping lots more. But my physical health is coming back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But emotionally I’m still dealing with coming off an ultra high. This was something I did not expect.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To tackle this low feeling, she made the classic runner move and agreed to run the Chicago Marathon in October with the Lululemon team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now a fully fledged runner with jiu jitsu on pause, Kwok is hoping to inspire inclusivity and representation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Further was bigger than just a sport. I hope that my journey can be an invitation for everyone to try something new and explore your full potential.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6hnJqkpJ16p7XTp5ysq1%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtiaoZzfY9osZ6qn2KAcX%2BSamqkpV2qu6Wx0WawnpmiYrWww4yhpqefXaC8r7OMnqWtqpWlv6a6xK6pZq6inriwecqwpqRlp5q7tXnFrqmtoJWnerW0xKdkrKCVYrWisIyerZ6qXZeypro%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzero-303313km-under-year-how-hong-kong-entrepreneur-vriko-kwok-went-further-then-she-had-ever-been.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./here-is-what-jj-da-boss-does-for-a-living.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./here-is-what-jj-da-boss-does-for-a-living.html>Here is what JJ Da Boss does for a living</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./every-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html>Every Action Has An Equal And Opposite Reaction</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./every-action-has-an-equal-and-opposite-reaction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
