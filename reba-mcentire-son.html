<time>26 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><strong>Who is Reba McEntire’s son?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-114562292.jpg><p>In Nashville, Tennessee, McEntire and Narvel Blackstock welcomed their son, Shelby Blackstock into the world on February 23rd, 1990. <a href=# rel=nofollow>As told to People</a>, McEntire went out of her way to parent Blackstock with humility and understanding that he had to fight for what he wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>With the discussion of “nepo-babies” so potent in 2022, celebrities like McEntire have made it apparent that her parental style didn’t feed such privilege. According to the article, “When McEntire, 67, became a mom to her son Shelby (with ex-husband Narvel Blackstock) in 1990, she made sure to <a href=# rel=nofollow>pass down those same values</a> she learned growing up in Chockie, Oklahoma. “When we would play games or cards, I’d never let Shelby win,” she said. “He wouldn’t have learned anything that way. I always told Shelby, ‘I’ll always love you, but I want other people to like you. So don’t be a little jerk. Don’t be a spoiled brat.'”</p><p>McEntire also gushed over her son’s triumphs. “I’m very proud of him,” she said. “He was a kid who had ADHD and could barely read in school, and now he’s read 10 books this year. He’s always trying to improve and do better. His daddy did a great job too.” The relationship that McEntire has with her son flourishes as she acknowledges both his early struggles and new achievements. In interviews, McEntire speaks about how her son changed her life for the better and was her proclaimed gift from God. Even with so many accolades amongst her resume, McEntire always prioritized her motherhood and did her best to be there for Shelby in regard to school.</p><p>Shelby Blackstock is known for his work as a racecar driver. He began his career when he attended the Bondurant Racing School. He began racing in 2010 for the Skip Barber Summer Series and then in 2011 for the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge. In the year 2010, he went from 24th position, accumulating over 191 points, and then ten years later, became 1st for the GT World Challenge America Powered by Aws and accumulated 300 points. So far, his last race was also in 2020 for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.</p><p>From NBC, McEntire spoke about Blackstock’s origin story as a racecar driver, saying, “Shelby would jump on a golf cart, and he would be driving. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could barely touch the gas pedal</a>. He would drive me around the place, and he would say, ‘Hang on! It’s going to be a bumpy ride!’ and we would chase the geese all around,” she remembered.” McEntire and Blackstock are able to bond over racecar driving because of the similarities the career keeps to rodeoing, an evident part of the McEntire background.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the racetrack, his love life has also driven him to a destination. According to PEOPLE, Marissa Branch, Blackstock’s wife says the two met and matched on Tinder in 2014. The two recently were married at the Epcot and Magic Kingdom in 2022, as Branch is a very passionate Disney fan. Their aisle song for the wedding was even “Tale as Old as Time” from Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>On behalf of the song, Branch said: “Though I’ve loved the tune long before I ever had any real ideas of marriage, its lyrics perfectly capture what any bride would be feeling,” Branch said. “I know once I reach the altar it will be a true fairytale moment, with my handsome (fortunately not beastly), almost-husband waiting for me.” The newlyweds now share two dogs together, and so when Blackstock isn’t driving, he’s at home carrying out his husband’s duties.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
