She sang and wrote songs with the band Isreal and Breed for several years, won a Dove Gospel Music Award, and received a Grammy nomination on the side.</p><p>She was married to Grammy award winner and gospel music artist Isreal Houghton for over 20 years before divorcing him – they have 3 children together. Meleasa has contributed to several popular gospel songs, including Our Presence, Jesus at the Center, Rez Power, Your Presence is Heaven, and others.</p><h2><strong>Meleasa Houghton – Biography</strong></h2><p>Meleasa Houghton was born on March 1, 1964, in the United States of America. From an early age, she dedicated her life to Christ and the ministry of the Gospel. While working in Christian ministry, she came to meet her would-be husband Israel.</p><p>While details about her family and early life were kept from the media, Meleasa provided some insights into her childhood. Recently she thanked her mother on social media for raising her in the way of God and teaching her to be strong through her actions. It is obvious that her family was a closely-knit Christian family.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Meleasa-Houghton.jpg fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="Meleasa Houghton" width=768 height=539 title="Meleasa Houghton Bio, Affairs, Divorce and Facts About Israel Houghton’s Ex-Wife" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Meleasa got to know Israel during his ministry in Pittsburgh, and the couple began a relationship. After a stormy romance, they married in 1994 and built a house for themselves based on trust, mutual respect, and love for Christ. During their marriage, they had three children together – Mariah Houghton (their first daughter, who married her longtime boyfriend (Byron Rideau)), Israel II Houghton, and Milan Houghton.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jeff Jampol Biography, Net Worth, Height, Age, Married, Family</a></strong></p><p>After her marriage to Israel, she became part of his Israel and Breed Band, where she officially began her gospel music career. Her commitment and dedication paid off when she won the Gospel Music Artist Dove Award in the category “Traditional Gospel Song of the Year” in 2015. Meleasa also received a Grammy Award nomination in the category “Best Gospel Performance/Song of the Year 2016”. She has worked on several popular songs including: “Chasing Me Down”, “How Awesome is Our God”, “It’s Not Over”, “Alpha and Omega” and others.</p><p>Meleasa Houghton is quite active on Instagram with over 12,000 followers. It seems that the musical gene runs in the family, as she has passed on videos of her talented children singing and playing various instruments.</p><h2><strong>Divorce And Affairs</strong></h2><p>Meleasa was married to Israel Houghton for over 20 years. Israel is a leader of folklore, songwriter, and music producer. Since 1997, he has released more than 13 albums, 11 of them under his personal music label. He has been nominated for numerous prestigious awards, of which he has won 2 Stellar Awards, 6 Grammy Awards, and 11 GMA Dove Awards.</p><p>Isreal and Meleasa finally broke up when Israel openly admitted that “he sinned in his marriage”. Although he did not go into the nature of his “sin”, there was speculation and the conclusion was drawn that he had been unfaithful to his wife. They separated in 2014 and their divorce was finalized on February 22, 2016.</p><p>The confession of Israel triggered a lot of discussion within the evangelical Christian community. He was suspended indefinitely as a worship leader in his local church, Lakewood Church, led by Joel Osteen. People were outraged that such a respected gospel artist could be involved in such a scandal.</p><p>Israel seems like a devout worshipper, and people wondered how he could have fallen victim to such a life. It seems that the first step to healing and forgiveness was to make a clean slate of what he had done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Meleasa-Houghton.jpg><p>While Meleasa didn’t say much during the whole scandal and the dirty affair, Israel said that they maintained their friendship even after the divorce. Israel seems to have found love again since he has moved on to this day and married the TV personality and singer <a href=#>Adrienne Bailon</a>. They got married on November 11, 2016.</p><p>Meleasa, on the other hand, after her divorce, seems to focus on her career, her children, and her relationship with God. It is uncertain if she is seeing anyone right now, as she has not shared any information or news about her private life.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Erin Lim Bio, Age, Wiki, Boyfriend, Husband, Ethnicity</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Facts About Israel Houghton’s Ex-Wife</strong></h2><p>– Meleasa is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs about 60 kg</p><p>– She has neither a Facebook nor a Twitter account.
