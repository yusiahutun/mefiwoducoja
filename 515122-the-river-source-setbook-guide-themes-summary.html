The first focuses on the birth of Akoko, her childhood, and marriage, the second on Akoko’s daughter, the third on her granddaughter Elizabeth, and the fourth on her great-grandchildren. Below are the four parts of the book:</p><h3>Part one</h3><p class=align-left><i>The River and the Source</i> begins with the birth of Akoko. She is the first daughter of the Chief of Yimbo, Odero Gogni. She is married off to Owuor Kembo, who pays thirty heads of cattle. The two are blessed with three children, Obura, Owang’Sino and Nyabera.</p><p class=align-left>Her husband and the two sons pass away, leaving her in the hands of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Otieno Kembo</a>, her brother-in-law. Otieno takes over Akoko’s property, but defiantly, she manages to get some back with the help of a white man in <a href=#>Kisumu</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d8d8ab9c4883c337.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inheritance by David Mulwa setbook guide, themes, and summary</span></p></a><h3>Part two</h3><p class=align-left>Akoko’s daughter, Nyabera, is married to Okumu. However, after her husband’s death, she is inherited by Ogama Kwach as their customs dictate. The two sire two kids, but both succumb to sickle cell anaemia.</p><p class=align-left>In pain, Nyabera seeks refuge at Aluor Mission, where she is later joined by her mother, her daughter Awiti and her nephew. Even though Nyabera’s nephew is the rightful heir to Owuor Kembo, he drops the desire to succeed as chief to join the priesthood.</p><p class=align-left>Awiti trains as a teacher and meets former soldier, Mark Sigu. Akoko dies peacefully in her sleep after meeting Sigu, and her mass is presided over by Peter Kembo. Awiti is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">christened Elizabeth</a>, and together with Sigu, they relocate to Nakuru to start a <a href=#>family</a>.</p><h3>Part three</h3><p class=align-left>Elizabeth's firstborn child with Mark Sigu dies due to the couple’s ignorance, but soon afterwards, they are blessed with a set of twins. They relocate back to the mission due to political tension in <a href=# rel=noopener>Nakuru</a> as the country struggles for independence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8d36fb4f026b5f9a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danstan Omari, 14 Other Candidates Shortlisted for DPP Position</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Upon returning to Nakuru, the couple is blessed with another boy, Tony, a set of twins, Odongo and Opiyo and a last-born daughter, Mary.

This is no different for Margaret Ogola’s novel, as some of the themes in <i>The River and the Source</i> include:</p><h3>1. Tradition</h3><p class=align-left>The story begins in a rural village in Luo, where tradition is deeply woven into every aspect of the people's life. The <a href=#>customs and traditions</a> of the Luo people guide their society. However, Akoko does everything possible to defy the traditions that undermine and oppress women.</p><h3>2. Female empowerment</h3><p class=align-left>Feminism in <i>The River and the Source</i> is depicted through female empowerment. Akoko models female empowerment for women in her lineage. Throughout, the author offers many examples of women who push against the idea of women being lesser worthy than men.</p><h3>3. Colonialism</h3><p class=align-left>Colonialism affects all the characters and their lives in the society. For instance, the Luo people are amused and in disbelief about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">white people</a>. In addition, the events leading up to the country’s independence have a significant impact on Mark and Elizabeth as young parents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eff23e008bc7937f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maandamano: Azimio Releases List of 9 Leaders, Associates Arrested Over Protests</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Elizabeth goes back to the mission to keep the children safe. Eventually, the lingering distrust between white and black people remained even after the country gained its independence.</p><h3>4. Cultural change</h3><p class=align-left>The novel revolves around the cultural upheavals transforming the Kenyan society. The broad cultural changes are revealed through the contrasting traditional Luo village where Akoko was raised and the Catholic mission where her daughter Nyabera was raised.</p><h3>5. Suffering and resilience</h3><p class=align-left>Suffering and resilience are emphasized in the novel. While most characters face lots of suffering, their resilience helps them push through. For instance, Akoko has a challenging time marked by the <a href=#>loss of her loved ones</a>, but her strong will helps her push through the troubles.</p><h3>6. Religion</h3><p class=align-left>The theme of religion is constant throughout the book. While the Luo people believe the creator, whom they call Were, Nyabera questions his existence after the death of her father and two brothers. Eventually, she finds refuge in Catholicism while Tony pursues the priesthood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed5234b8c85aec43.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 Beautiful Photos of Mama Ngina Kenyatta that Show She's Aging Gracefully</span></p></a><h3>7. Motherhood</h3><p class=align-left>As the author focuses on the four generations of Kenyan women, motherhood stands out as one of the key parts of their lives. In the beginning, the author emphasizes the worth of a woman based on her ability to bear many children, especially male kids.</p><p class=align-left>For this reason, Akoko and her daughter are pressured by internal and external factors when they fail to meet these expectations. Throughout the novel, we see women navigating the incredible joys and pains of motherhood.</p><h2>The River and the Source - Final word</h2><p class=align-left><i>The River and the Source </i>touches on political and cultural upheavals, the HIV epidemic, religion, and colonialism. However, the courage of the everyday African woman in their attempt to carve a better future for themselves and their children makes the novel stand out.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published an article about <i><a href=#>A Silent Song and Other Stories</a></i> summary notes.
