He is one of the few celebrities who keeps his kids out of the spotlight. As a result, not much is known about his son Ibrahim. However, there are some things about Ibrahim worth knowing about, and they include:</p><h3>1. Ibrahim Chappelle is the second born</h3><p class=align-left>David Chappelle married Elaine Mendoza in 2001, and the couple is blessed with three children. Their <a href=# title="Ibrahim Chappelle" rel="nofollow noopener">first child Sulayman</a> is a son born in 2001. That makes him around 19 years. Ibrahim is the second born. The youngest in the <a href=#>family</a> is Sonal, who is also the only daughter.</p><p class=align-left>While not much is known about Ibrahim's career, Sonal has already made a debut in Hollywood as a child star in the movie<i> A Star is Born</i>. Ibrahim Chappelle's birthday has not been disclosed to the public, but he is currently a high school teenager.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/72a59f054970f7a8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Aman Tyler Perry: What you should know about Tyler Perry's son</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cc1ac05a659d7d6f.png><h3>2. He is a Kevin Hart die-hard fan</h3><p class=align-left>With his father being a successful comedian, Ibrahim has come across celebrities from the same industries. One comedian that he adores is Kevin Hart. In a <a href=#>Netflix</a> special, Dave Chappelle revealed that Ibrahim asked for $250 to see a <a href=# title="Ibrahim Chappelle" rel="nofollow noopener">Kevin Hart show</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Since Ibrahim Chappelle and Dave Chappelle have a strong bond, the father did not feel jealous that his son adored another comedian. After the show, Dave even went further and took Ibrahim backstage to meet his idol.</p><h3>3. He was born to interracial parents</h3><p class=align-left>While Chappelle is an African American, Ibrahim's mother, Elaine, is of Filipino descent. Ibrahim was born in Yellow Springs, Ohio. That means Ibrahim is of mixed ethnicity while his nationality is American. Being born to a biracial family enables him to be exposed to both of his parent's cultures.</p><h3>4. He comes from an interfaith family</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61f23fd4621995ec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sulayman Chappelle: 5 fast facts about Dave Chappelle's eldest son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sulayman Chappelle and Ibrahim Chappelle have Muslim names due to their father's religion. David, their father, <a href=# title="Ibrahim Chappelle" rel="nofollow noopener">converted to Islam </a>in 1998. He was first attracted to the faith at 17 years while visiting a local pizza shop run by Muslim staff.</p><p class=align-left>Dave continues to be a firm adherent of the Islamic faith. On the other hand, Ibrahim's mother is a Christian who is always by her husband's side. While the interfaith couples have both kept their religions, they raise their children in a supportive household.</p><h3>5. Dave Chappelle's son lives in Ohio</h3><p class=align-left>The Chappelle family lives in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It is also the same area where Ibrahim was born and has spent most of his childhood. The home is located on a 39-acre farm and has a private gated entrance. While growing up, Chappelle spent most of his summers in Yellow spring with his dad, which influenced his decision to bring up a family in the same neighbourhood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bedfa9d324eeaab1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Matthew Trebek: 5 things to know about Alex Trebek's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ibrahim Chappelle was born to a father who is one of the most famous comedians globally and a mother who prefers not to live life in the public eye. Due to his father's fame, he has also gained much public attention. While not much is known about his career, Ibrahim is still young and has plenty of time to pursue any profession.</p><p class=align-left>In other news, <a href=#>tuko.co.ke</a> recently published an article on the 10 best black male <a href=#>stand-up comedians</a> of all time.
