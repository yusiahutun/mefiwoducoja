Let’s just say Dane is not his favourite person.”</p><p>And she says Simon was furious with Bowers for calling his girlfriend a “minger”, even though it was part of a game. “Simon got a bit stressed about that,” says the 34D beauty.</p><p>“I’ve tried explaining it was all part of a task which I didn’t know about. He wasn’t happy. He thought Dane was two-faced.”</p><p>But Nicola, who has a 14-month-old daughter Poppy with Simon, says the 22-year-old Crewe Alexandra midfielder has nothing to worry about.</p><p>“I was close to Dane but I don’t fancy him and I would never have made a move on him,” she says. “He reminds me too much of my ex.”</p><p>Nicola reckons Dane is looking forward to tonight’s final because he’ll finally be able to get away from Alex Reid.</p><p>She claims Jordan’s past and present lovers do not get on.</p><p>“There was definitely tension there,” says Nicola. “They didn’t get on too well and there were awkward moments. For instance, Alex didn’t like Dane talking about the sex tape he had made with Jordan. Alex loves Jordan and he is going to be pissed off with chat about that.</p><p>“He sat there and I could tell he wasn’t happy. I was looking at him and saying ‘Alex just smile.’”</p><p>And she says Dane became irritated with Alex constantly complaining about getting bad press.</p><p>“He felt he milked it too much,” she says. “He’d go on about his cross- dressing and the press talking about it, and how his relationship with Jordan was bigger news than the death of Michael Jackson.</p><p>“Dane just thought that if Alex had come on the show to change people’s perceptions of him, he wasn’t doing himself any favours.”</p><p>Nicola was shocked in the house when both Alex and Dane gave her the cold shoulder after she asked them about rumours they had a fight at a New Year party hosted by Jordan, alias Kate Price, 31.</p><p>“I got told off by them for trying to talk about this fight,” she reveals.</p><p>“I had read about it in the papers before we went in the house and wanted to know what happened.”</p><p>Dane fuelled the rumours by entering the house sporting a scar above his eye.</p><p>“He also had a bad knee and he was getting quite stressed about it,” she says. “I was asking about that night, but he just said: ‘I will tell you about it when we get out.’”</p><p>Nicola has already chosen her winner – she hopes Alex will be the champ tonight.</p><p>“It would be amazing to think he walked into that house to boos and then comes out the winner,” she says.</p><p>The gossip-mad beauty continues: “I wish I could have found out more about Jordan. But he was clearly under some rules and there obviously was a reason he wasn’t able to talk about things. He’d say ‘my partner’ or ‘you know who’. I don’t know but someone clearly advised him about what he should or shouldn’t say.</p><p>“The thing is, we were all naturally interested in one another’s lives.</p><p>“Alex would only talk about Jordan when we asked him.”</p><p>Having got to know the cage-fighter, Nicola predicts that it won’t be long before Alex, 34, proposes to Kate.</p><p>“He is smitten with her,” she says. “I don’t know what’s going to happen after this but if it works out between them he will be the happiest man on Earth.</p><p>“He even asked me for advice about diamonds so I do think he is looking to propose somewhere down the line.</p><p>“He has held back from saying a lot of things but I think marriage could happen.”</p><p>Nicola is even hoping to get an invit­ation to the big day, as long as Kate doesn’t mind that she pampered Alex while they were in the house. “I’d love to go to the wedding,” she says. “I just hope Kate isn’t angry about me spray-tanning Alex. My Simon thought it was funny so I hope she did too.</p><p>“I’m not scared of her. I mean I even picked his spots and I am sure she will say to me: ‘Thank you for getting rid of his spots.’”</p><p>Nicola did upset a few viewers during her time in the house because the sexy model never went topless.</p><p>“I did think about taking my top off,” she says. “Stephanie kept saying my boobs were small so I thought about getting them out to show her.</p><p>“But the opportunity never came up. And it was winter!”</p><p>Since leaving the house in Wednesday’s double eviction, Nicola has been shocked to see what some of her exhousemates have been saying about her.</p><p>And she’s furious with Bible-thumper Stephen Baldwin, 43, who claimed she was “evil” and “a dark force” in the house. “I might have the devil in me at times but it’s mean to call me evil,” she stormed. “What’s he playing at?”</p><p>But she showed off her devilish side by revealing she tried hard to find out which of the guys had the biggest willy.</p><p>“At first I thought Sisqo had the biggest one, after seeing him in that mankini,” she giggles. “But then I thought maybe that was only because he is short.</p><p>“So I now think Jonas has the biggest. I never saw Alex’s though. When I tanned him he covered up with a towel.”</p><p>Nicola says she has no regrets about her time on the show, and didn’t even mind fellow housemate Ivana Trump calling her “the least famous person” in the house.</p><p>“I probably was the least famous,” she admits. “But I’m hoping this will help me get a lot of opportunities now.</p><p>“I’d love to do TV presenting. I’ve got a single with Coolio coming out, I’d love a chat show, and I’d love my own gossip column.</p><p>“Just call me greedy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLuqr86lmGalkaN6qMHNp6Cnn12Zrq%2BxjGpva2xja4B3</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnicola-man-gunning-dane-18243636.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./police-identify-teen-killed-in-years-first-des-moines-homicide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./police-identify-teen-killed-in-years-first-des-moines-homicide.html>Police identify teen killed in years first Des Moines homicide</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-the-beautiful-girlfriend-of-ryan-paevey-know-about-his-dating-history-also-see-his-career-net-worth-and-salary.html>Meet the beautiful girlfriend of actor Ryan Paevey: Learn about his dating history: Also see his jou</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-the-beautiful-girlfriend-of-ryan-paevey-know-about-his-dating-history-also-see-his-career-net-worth-and-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
