But now? "I am so in. Now, we are big super-nerd fans of 'The Office' because we've been rewatching it again from the beginning. I dont think there's ever gonna be a reboot, but we really want an 'Office reunion."</p><p>Both women agreed that they were pushing for it to happen, but there was just one problem.

Both agreed that things were still probably a "hot mess" for Kelly and Ryan, which definitely tracks.</p><p>But they took a darker turn when talking about a couple of their cast-mates, with Angela predicting that Stanley is probably juggling multiple familes by now (this also tracks), and Jenna going even darker for Phyllis.</p><p>When Andy asked if she thought that Phyllis and Bob Vance were still hooking up, Jenna quickly predicted, "Phyllis had Bob killed and collected the money." As Angela looked on in shock, she added with a smile, "It's a little-known fact."</p><p>Maybe Phyllis was the Scranton Strangler?!

"And he was like, 'No, I want them all to wrap together.' And we had this big group scene and we were all together and they said, 'That is a series wrap on the cast of 'The Office.'"</p><p>As the ladies put it, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. "I'm gonna cry now," Jenna said just from hearing the story, and it really was very touching and beautiful. What a wonderful statement from Daniels about the love and respect he had for his ensemble.</p><p>"The Office" succeeded when it went deep into its ensemble and every one of them helped it achieve its current status as a modern classic, so its heartwarming that he was able to appreciate that and honor it then.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:cac6ca22-af46-5633-8134-e274ea6f8ff3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7f023a89-2af9-5a17-bce0-dd1577aa4694 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bd/5by4/2019/10/17/bd0ed9911c7e59afb1d4889c13cdf1f5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'The Batman' Found Its Riddler In Paul Dano</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Meeting Billie</h2><p>Billie Eilish is kind of a big deal, so you'd think Angela would have been pretty excited about meeting her when the two of them recently ran into one another. Billie was certainly excited to meet Angela, sharing the moment to her Instagram page. But it was only then that Angela realized something.</p><p>"I'm like a hundred years old, so when Billie came up to me, she was like, 'Hey, I'm a big fan, can I get a picture.' And I was like, 'Sure,'" Angela said. "No idea." As in she had no idea who this person was, thinking Billie was just another fan.</p><p>"And she was really sweet," Angela continued. "And then she posted it on Instagram and then all of a sudden all these people were tagging me and I was like, 'Ooh. Oh.'" And then she figured out who Billie Eilish was, and then she checked out her music and she digs it. So all is right in the world and next time they meet, maybe Angela can ask for a picture with Billie.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d1de03fd-911e-5d8e-b772-0547b41ae27e data-container-ref=toofab:article:7f023a89-2af9-5a17-bce0-dd1577aa4694 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/5by4/2019/10/17/6305caa582e95ce8b50cf7c0042db929_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Aniston Talks Breaking Instagram, Telling Women's Stories on 'The Morning Show'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Office Playhouse</h2><p>Finally, Andy invited the "Office Ladies" to step into the world of "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" for an iconic scene with Shereé Whitfield that had finger wagging and yelling and everything a "Housewives" fan could want. Even better, Angela and Jenna really went for it, clearly having fun playing off of one another again in a scene.</p><p>Come to think of it, the character of Angela from "The Office" would make a great "Housewife," which we saw a hint of when Angela starred in the parody series "The Hotwives of Orlando" for Hulu back in 2014.</p><p>The premiere episode of the <strong><a href=#>"Office Ladies"</a></strong> podcast is available for streaming now.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
