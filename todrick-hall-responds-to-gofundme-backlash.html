I almost didn't answer because I was in a work meeting, but my brother knows I'm not a FaceTime guy and it was very abnormal for him to call me multiple times back to back," Todrick wrote on the page.</p><p>He went on to share, "I answered the call to him screaming and freaking out the house was burning down. He was home alone and trying to call my parents and no one was answering."</p><p>His mother was in fact with Hall at the time in Los Angeles, "So I ran downstairs to let her know and she was as you can expect very devastated."</p><p>The page initially asked for $10,000, a goal which has now been met and continues to grow. However, some fans were skeptical as to why Hall couldn't provide the funds himself, being a successful recording artist; the criticism grew louder after he then had what appeared to many as a swanky birthday party.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1327667d-4e88-4019-8dcc-5810e6992c5e data-container-ref=toofab:article:0dfb5751-b96e-4369-9d03-906a1482fcc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a6/5by4/2022/04/07/a65e3cd6d293420bacf64ed823bee8f4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Todrick Hall Responds to 'Shady' Haters and Allegations He Threatened to Out Someone's HIV Status</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Todrick Hall posted a GoFundMe asking strangers for 10K for his family house that burned down but then hosted his birthday party last night where he had horses and a petting zoo… like…" one highly popular tweet claimed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hall took to Instagram to share screenshots of the abuse he has been receiving regarding the GoFundMe account, which include aggressive homophobic and racial slurs. While he said he doesn't "expect everyone to understand my life" and said "I know I'm not for everyone," he called the "level of hate" not only unacceptable but "dangerous."</p><p>"I hate that I even have to respond to this," Hall captioned the carousel of insults, before saying, "I just want to be crystal clear, I would NEVER spend money that my fans raised during a traumatic time for my family on a birthday party."</p><p>"I wouldn't under these circumstances spend my own money on a party either," he added, claiming everything at the celebration was "either gifted or sponsored" and organized by someone close to him who "wanted to celebrate me on my birthday and going away party."</p><p>He also thanked fans for their support.</p><p>He previously explained on the GoFundMe page that he has helped his family but is going through his own "transitional" period following the pandemic and strikes just last year.</p><p>"I do not come from money, at all, and typically I would be the person to step up to the plate to help," Hall continued. "But, as a performer who's just recovering from the pandemic and the union strike myself there's only so much I can do so. I have helped where I can, but I can't get the entire family back on their feet at this moment as I'm transitional period myself."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9b7c0f13-696c-46c0-9110-8ff09cb46ed9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0dfb5751-b96e-4369-9d03-906a1482fcc8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=31><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/5by4/2023/01/22/564f06887e364f6694df52ce6a25c0e5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Todrick Hall on Real Friends of Weho Backlash, Bullying, Insists He Bought House, Pays Dancers</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXBfqbylvsicomagkaG5br7ErKeoppSoerW7jKCmn62embqmecGamqSkkai1cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftodrick-hall-responds-to-gofundme-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./16-intriguing-facts-about-jane-curtin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./16-intriguing-facts-about-jane-curtin.html>16 Intriguing Facts About Jane Curtin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tiger-woods-body-transformation-4am-workouts-html.html>Inside Tiger Woods' insane body transformation: How 4am workouts helped the 15-time major winner bul</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tiger-woods-body-transformation-4am-workouts-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
