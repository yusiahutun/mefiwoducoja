Stewart and Meyer, who met in 2013 but didn’t start dating until 2019, got engaged in 2021 after two years of dating. But who is <a href=# id=auto-tag_kristen-stewart data-tag=kristen-stewart>Kristen Stewart</a>‘s partner, Dylan Meyer? We have those answers ahead.</p><p>Stewart, who identifies as queer, has dated several celebrities in Hollywood including her Speak co-star Michael Angarano, her Twilight co-star <a href=# rel=noopener>Robert Pattinson</a>, producer <a href=# rel=noopener>Alicia Cargile</a> and model Stella Maxwell. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">InStyle</a> in November 2020, Stewart opened up about the “pressure” to come out.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kristen-Stewart.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kristen-stewart-2022-oscars-makeup.png><p>“The first time I ever dated a girl, I was immediately being asked if I was a lesbian. And it’s like, ‘God, I’m 21 years old,'” she said. “I felt like maybe there were things that have hurt people I’ve been with. Not because I felt ashamed of being openly gay but because I didn’t like giving myself to the public, in a way. It felt like such thievery. This was a period of time when I was sort of cagey.”</p><p>Stewart explained why she’s been so <a href=# rel=noopener>private about her relationships</a> in the past.&nbsp;“Even in my previous relationships, which were straight, we did everything we could to not be photographed doing things—things that would become not ours,” she said at the time. “So I think the added pressure of representing a group of people, of representing queerness, wasn’t something I understood then. Only now can I see it. Retrospectively, I can tell you I have experience with this story. But back then I would have been like, ‘No, I’m fine. My parents are fine with it. Everything’s fine.; That’s bullshit. It’s been hard. It’s been weird. It’s that way for everyone.”</p><p>So who is Kristen Stewart’s partner, Dylan Meyer, and how did they meet?

When asked of how she planned to propose to Meyer, Stewart said, “I can’t say right now, because she’ll find out.” She also confirmed that their engagement won’t be “tied to any weird sort of convention; it’s just, like, when you know, you know.”</p><p>Two years later, Stewart confirmed that she Meyer were engaged in another interview with Stern. “We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” she announced in November 2021. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”</p><h2>Who is Kristen Stewart’s fiancée Dylan Meyer?</h2><p>So who is Kristen Stewart’s fiancée Dylan Meyer? Like Stewart, Meyer was born and raised in Los Angeles, which is one of the reasons they bonded when they first met.&nbsp; “It was so obvious,” Stewart told Stern in 2019. “We’re both from L.A. and we really love L.A.
