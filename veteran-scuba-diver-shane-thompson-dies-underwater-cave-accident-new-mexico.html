The group has been working on surveying the underwater cave system since 2013.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Thompson dove into Blue Pool on March 26 with another experienced diver, Mike Young, Gallegos said. They planned to have Young enter part of the cave system while Thompson stayed outside in a safety role.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Instead of staying outside, Thompson entered, Gallegos said. “Apparently something went horribly wrong, and he started to panic,” the chief said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The divers were about 160 feet below the surface when the incident happened.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It still was unclear Thursday what went wrong. It could be weeks before preliminary autopsy results are available, the state Office of the Medical Investigator said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Family members said Thursday they were struggling with Thompson’s death, but they acknowledged that diving was what he loved to do and that he had earned numerous certifications over his lifetime.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A navy veteran, Thompson began diving at a young age while growing up in the Florida Keys. After earning his first certification, he went to work for an underwater construction company and later started numerous diving businesses that focused on everything from boat maintenance to salvage work and training.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Last year, Thompson rediscovered the wreckage of the B-36 “Peacemaker” bomber that had crashed in 1952 near Mission Beach. A video posted by Thompson’s San Diego-based Advanced Underwater Training business shows his flashlight scanning the engines and other corroded pieces of the plane as he makes his way through the darkness more than 250 feet below the surface.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In New Mexico, the Blue Hole has been an attraction for centuries. Legend has it that outlaw Billy the Kid would take a dip at the swimming hole before heading into Santa Rosa.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The artesian spring, tucked into a rock outcropping, pumps out about 3,000 gallons per minute. The steady flow results in crystal clear conditions that have attracted divers from around the world.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At the bottom of the bell-shaped spring, there’s a metal grate that keeps divers from going any farther.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“From that point on it goes into a maze – kind of looks like intestines,” said Gallegos, a longtime Santa Rosa resident who has seen a three-dimensional model of the cave system.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The caves have been sealed off since 1976, when two divers in training died after getting separated from their classmates. New Mexico State Police divers quickly found one of the bodies, but it took several weeks to find the other. In the process, police divers made a crude map of some of the unexplored passageways.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At that time, one of the divers descended close to 200 feet and found himself at the edge of an underwater cliff. His powerful flashlight wasn’t enough to see the cave wall across from him or the bottom, sparking only more curiosity.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 2013, divers with the ADM Exploration Foundation attempted an expedition, but they had little success getting past the tons of rock the city dumped onto the grate to keep people out.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Divers with the foundation returned in 2015 for more excavation work and were able to reach a depth of 160 feet. They returned in late March to continue surveying.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Divers from around the region flock to Blue Hole for fun and certification, as it’s one of the best diving spots in the American Southwest. About 8,000 dive permits are sold each year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2jYrumw9JoaWlpZmS6or6ObGhorpWpsrOtzWaqnK2SlnqltdWeqWarmJa7pnnToaamqKOku26wyJ6qZq2embKzw8CtnKtlk5bDpnnAnJqinJWjwW66xLBkpp2onrCw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fveteran-scuba-diver-shane-thompson-dies-underwater-cave-accident-new-mexico.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wilmington-del-gets-noise-ordinance-proposal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wilmington-del-gets-noise-ordinance-proposal.html>Wilmington, N.C., Gets Noise Ordinance Proposal</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./miley-cyrus-flashes-abs-toned-legs-white-cut-dress-sings-jaded-html.html>Miley Cyrus flashes her abs and toned legs in white cut-out dress as she sings Jaded</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./miley-cyrus-flashes-abs-toned-legs-white-cut-dress-sings-jaded-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
