I can look at life in a different way and not settle. I can have my own voice and my own vision.’ So that was an important element.”</p><p>Madonna also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2019 about her plans for her music at the time. “I’m just looking for interesting, fun ways to rerelease my catalog and introduce my music to a new generation. I’m focused on that and I’ve been writing a screenplay for my film for the last couple of years. The whole thing with Frozen was so fun, but I woke up one day and went, ‘I’m sick of living in the past!’ I want to go on tour again, I’m a creature of the stage. That is my happy place,” she said.</p><p>Madonna, who is also working on a biopic movie about her life and career starring Julia Garner, also told Variety about why she wanted to create the film. “I have a very long script that is really hard for me to make shorter. I’ve been whittling away at it, but it’s like hacking off my limbs,” she said. “I’ve had an extraordinary life, I must make an extraordinary film. It was also a preemptive strike because a lot of people were trying to make movies about me. Mostly misogynistic men. So I put my foot in the door and said, ‘No one’s going to tell my story, but me.'”</p><p>Madonna also told Oprah Winfrey and<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> O magazine</a> in 2004 about how she would describe her job. “I’ve got lots of fears. My job is to conquer my fears. The irony of being a performer is that I have huge insecurities. People are shocked to hear that I think my legs are fat or I don’t like the way I look. We all have insecurities. We’d be lying if we said we didn’t,” she said.</p><p>She also told Oprah about the fundamental principle that influences her life. “Each of us is responsible for everything that happens in our lives. When good things happen—we win an award, meet the love of our lives, or get a promotion—we take ownership of that. But when bad things happen—we get fired or we divorce—we often don’t take responsibility. We call it something that just happened. I now understand that just as we can draw the positive, we can draw the negative,” she said.</p><p>Madonna also O magazine about how her spirituality affects her music. “I’ve never felt more creative,” she said. “One thing I’ve learned is that I’m not the owner of my talent, I’m the manager of it. And if I learn how to manage my talent correctly—and if I accept that I’m just channeling things that come from God—the talent will keep flowing through me.”</p><h2>Who is Madonna’s Celebration Tour opening act?</h2><p>Who is Madonna’s Celebration Tour opening act? Madonna’s opening act for The Celebration Tour is Bob the Drag Queen, whose real name is Christopher D. Caldwell. Bob, who also uses the stage name Caldwell Tidicue, is a drag queen and the winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race season 8. Bob was also a host on HBO’s reality television show We’re Here, alongside drag queens Eureka O’Hara and Shangela.</p><p>In a past interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Grazia</a>, Bob explained his drag style. “It’s very mature, without being elderly. You know, mature without being matrilineal. I would say it’s way more matriarchal than matrilineal,” he said. He also revealed what being an “authentic self” means to him. “Well, I think it can change a lot. There’s no constant for what your authentic self has to be. Like when people you’ve met in high school are like, ‘Oh, you changed?’ Like I’m thirty-five now? So I hope I’m a little different from what I was fifteen years ago,” he said. He also told Grazia about how his life has changed since winning RuPaul’s Drag Race. “Being on RuPaul’s Drag Race and winning has been one of the most pivotal moments in my career up to this point. I am so happy to have done the show and think about it all the time. I was so incredibly happy and lucky to be alive at a time when it was happening and still in my prime,” he said. “So grateful! I look back very fondly.”</p><p><span class=s1>Madonna tickets to The Celebration Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.
