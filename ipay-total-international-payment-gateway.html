You can and you must pro-actively organize and live your life. No one else can do it for you.</p><p>Managing Your Life is Much More than Career Management: Work (career, wealth) is just one aspect of life. There are other crucial areas which need to get adequate and regular attention in order to lead a fulfilled life: social area (family, friends, recognition), health area (sports, relaxation, diet, well-being and fitness), and spiritual area (fulfillment, religion, love, philosophy).</p><p>Write Down Your Personal Vision and Mission of Life: Ask yourself what’s really important for you, what you would like to achieve, what you are really good at, what your values are, and what you want to look back on at the end of your life?</p><p>Determine and write down what you’d like to achieve in each of your life areas. This allows you to anchor your personal life vision in your ongoing schedule. At the same time it will add meaningful content to your life. There always will be external tasks and deadlines which you will need to comply with. It’s a fact of life. Still, in order to master your life, you will also need to set your own priorities in order to concentrate on your important professional and private goals. You need to control your day in order to control your life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLaxrdhmq6iskaF6qrrTnqmnmaSevK%2Bty2anmrGdmru1ecaaq56vka4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fipay-total-international-payment-gateway.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mc-lyte-husband-net-worth-children-married-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mc-lyte-husband-net-worth-children-married-html.html>Mc Lyte Struggles with Divorce- Says Her Husband Does Not Want to Separate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-use-journalctl-to-read-linux-system-logs.html>How to Use journalctl to Read Linux System Logs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-use-journalctl-to-read-linux-system-logs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
