Adding to the hype, her move to Gagosian in May made her the mega-gallery’s youngest talent—but the Calgary-born artist isn’t letting her whirlwind ascension get to her head.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I realized early on that I have to take my ego out of it and just ride the wave,” Weyant tells Harper’s Bazaar regarding the pressure and loss of control she felt when her works hit the auction block. While jaw-dropping prices undeniably generate publicity, artists do not collect earnings from secondary market sales. “It’s not something I am going to worry about or necessarily feel proud of,” says Weyant. “Personally, it feels like such a small part of my story.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I realized early on that I have to take my ego out of it and just ride the wave.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Weyant’s latest chapter is her debut solo show at Gagosian, open from November 3 to December 23 in New York. Taking its name from a Lenny Kravitz lyric—Weyant often titles works after her musical preferences, which range from classic rock to Eminem—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/anna-weyant-baby-it-aint-over-till-its-over/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Baby, It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Baby, It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over</a> features ten new drawings and seven new paintings that are among her largest works yet—and they’ve already all sold on opening day. “I can be a bit reserved, and it was really important for me to let myself just be as an artist with this show,” says Weyant, whose past gallery representation includes 56 Henry in New York and Blum & Poe in Los Angeles. “I wanted to let the figures take up space in this really public and intimidating space. I want them to own the room.”</p><img alt="anna weyant painting of two flower vases" title="anna weyant painting of two flower vases" width=6500 height=3252 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/weyan-2022-0009-crp-1667576411.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Gagosian</span><p>Anna Weyant, It Must Have Been Love, 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The artist most enjoys working alone in the living room of her charming Upper West Side one-bedroom apartment, where she proudly displays books on Northern Renaissance art and finds immense joy hand-building a dollhouse that she plans to adorn with miniature artworks made by her friends. (Dollhouses were the theme of her first solo show at 56 Henry in 2019.) Every morning she has coffee beside an aged painter’s palette that belonged to late Polish-French modern painter Balthus, whose dreamlike depictions of girlish figures, although notoriously controversial, have hugely influenced Weyant. “You can see the way he picked up the paint because he used really bristly brushes,” she says, adding how much she also admires the work of Balthus’s wife, the Japanese painter and sculptor Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, who generously gifted the palette to the young artist last year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Weyant’s signature sepia-tone paintings echo Balthus’s melancholy hues, though she additionally attributes her preferred natural palette to her time in Hangzhou at the China Academy of Art, where she studied for seven months after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2017. There, works in smoky gray and deep green hues represented the prevailing aesthetic. “The academy valued figurative work and traditional Western European painting,” says Weyant, who particularly reveres British painter Lucian Freud. “That’s something I had always liked, but there I leaned into it.” She counts Americans John Currin, Will Cotton, and Lisa Yuskavage among her contemporary influences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Part of the magnetism of Weyant’s œuvre is her strategic oscillation between photorealism and surreality, which is at times intentionally cartoonish. She thrives in ambiguity and quietly relishes in a subtly sinister or somber darkness behind a sultry veneer. An obsession with the relentlessly predictable plots of Lifetime movies has fueled her desire to distort common tropes in her art. Rather than canned happy endings, Weyant prefers a “tougher German version of a fairy tale, where there are consequences for children” and more brutal realities. Complexity enriches Weyant’s works, not just technically but in the depth of their narratives. Hung against green velvet wallpaper supplied by design house F. Schumacher & Co., they, indeed, have a commanding presence on Gagosian’s rarefied walls, but upon closer inspection, they reflect the multifaceted inner world and imagination of an artist navigating the highs and lows of pleasure and pain and of the journey from adolescence into adulthood.</p><img alt="two women in white nightgowns" title="two women in white nightgowns" width=3250 height=4071 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/weyan-2022-0007-crp-1667576648.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Gagosian</span><p>Anna Weyant, Two Eileens, 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lighting is everything for Weyant, who is also inspired by high-contrast Dutch Golden Age paintings. “The lighting needs to be right to make a figure three-dimensional,” she explains. “I love when a figure is almost sculptural, and your eye can move around it.” She also imbues her portraits with an “at the window” immediacy, that, combined with her dramatic, chiaroscuro technique, makes her works especially cinematic. They might evoke the film noir glamour and peculiarity of Turner Classics Movies, which Weyant has admittedly been binging; the suspenseful eeriness of Hitchcock’s horror films; or the delicate wistfulness of Sofia Coppola’s withdrawn female characters. “Something I think Sofia Coppola does well is letting her protagonist drop the ball a little bit,” says Weyant. “She lets her female leads be complicated, flawed, and flexible. Marie Antoinette didn’t have to be either really good or really evil. There’s this space in between.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Good versus evil, light versus dark, innocence versus corruption, woman versus man, strength versus fragility—many of the dichotomies Weyant embraces can be traced to biblical Old Master paintings, such as those by Caravaggio and Leonardo da Vinci. Though she grew up atheist, Weyant appreciates the impact such works made on the art historical canon. “When looking at classical portraiture and religious art, I realized that women were always portrayed as maternal or holy figures upholding the ideals of beauty and purity,” says the artist who ultimately found their depictions “dreamy” but “static.” “I wanted to take them from that aesthetic and let my figures be more nuanced and human. Even if they mess up, they still get to be in the painting.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Figures and still lifes—they're like dinner and dessert for me. They’re so different, and I enjoy them both separately.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her new Gagosian show, several double portraits of friends and women she admires in slightly varying poses play off the biblical doubled image, meaning the idea of man being made in the image of God and born in the likeness of Adam, and therefore, having the capacity to be both righteous and sinful. Featured subjects include Eileen Kelly, a content creator and host of the Going Mental podcast; Emma Cline, a New York Times bestselling novelist; and legendary tennis player, Venus Williams, who modeled for the artist. Religious imagery extends into one of the largest works on view titled Sophie, after Sophie Cohen, who works as a sales and artist liaison at Gagosian. More than nine feet tall, the towering painting shows Sophie in a pose that is both standard in cheerleading and reminiscent of a crucifix. Rather than being stunted by a teammate, Sophie is stepping on a woman’s face — yet the woman appears to be another version of herself.</p><img alt="painting of cheerleader" title="painting of cheerleader" width=4401 height=6500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/weyan-2022-0005-crp-1667576529.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Gagosian</span><p>Anna Weyant, Sophie, 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Calling still lifes her “happy place,” Weyant is also adept at portraying inanimate objects. “Figures and still lifes—they're like dinner and dessert for me. They’re so different, and I enjoy them both separately,” she says. One of the most technically challenging works in Baby, It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over is She Drives Me Crazy, which features three silver pots whose gleaming surfaces reflect the silhouette of a man holding a knife. Suggesting a killer in the kitchen (Weyant decided to cut off a foot of “bloody” canvas to make the work less violent), the artist alludes to another American movie trope, while the figure’s cartoonish appearance lends humor and levity to the otherwise foreboding scene.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s these unexpected juxtapositions, an amalgamation of art history, pop culture, and personal experience executed so seamlessly, that makes Weyant’s intriguing works resonate — and she’s just getting started. “When an artist has market success early on in their career, I think that people feel like maybe there’s nowhere for them to go but down,” she says. “The title of the show was me riffing on that idea and saying, ‘I’m here. I’m not ready to throw in the towel. I’ll let you know when it’s over.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaabGFtg3iCl21mmqaelnq4sdiapa2rXZe8tbXCnqOloV2awLLBxGanmqGeqbavs9JmmKudXamurLXNoGStoJVirrPAjKaYq6OVqXqjxYysq6iqnWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanna-weyants-boticelli-esque-paintings-are-taking-the-art-market-by-storm.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charlotte-ritchie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charlotte-ritchie.html>Charlotte Ritchie Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./visit-mexico-riviera-maya-review.html>What it's like to stay in Mexico: Where to eat, stay and explore like a VIP</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./visit-mexico-riviera-maya-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
